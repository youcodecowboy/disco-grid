# Onboarding V2 Overhaul - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** Core Implementation Complete (~85%)

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive overhaul of the onboarding system, transforming it from a generic questionnaire into an intelligent, industry-specific experience that maximizes data collection while minimizing user burden.

## ✅ Completed Components

### Phase 1: Industry-Specific Contract System
**Files Created:**
- `app/onboarding-v2/types.contracts.manufacturing.ts` - Fashion & general manufacturing fields
- `app/onboarding-v2/types.contracts.construction.ts` - Project management & construction fields
- `app/onboarding-v2/types.contracts.defense.ts` - Compliance & defense contract fields
- `app/onboarding-v2/lib/contract-factory.ts` - Industry contract loading logic

**Updates:**
- `app/onboarding-v2/types.contract.ts` - Added Industry/SubIndustry types, industry extensions, committedFields tracking

**Details:**
- 3 industry-specific contracts with ~50-100 unique fields each
- Manufacturing: Fashion-specific (garments, fabrics, wash processes, sizing) + General (BOMs, production lines)
- Construction: Projects, subcontractors, permits, materials, phases, change orders
- Defense: Security clearances, specifications, deliverables, chain of custody, testing
- Field commitment tracking prevents duplicate questions

### Phase 2: Intelligent Question Engine
**Files Created:**
- `app/onboarding-v2/lib/question-engine.ts` - Dynamic question filtering system
- `app/onboarding-v2/lib/question-loader.ts` - Question bank loading by industry

**Functions:**
- `shouldShowQuestion()` - Checks industry match, dependencies, and if already answered
- `matchesIndustry()` - Industry/sub-industry filtering
- `dependenciesMet()` - Conditional logic evaluation
- `alreadyAnswered()` - Skip if data committed and has value
- `filterVisibleQuestions()` - Returns only applicable questions
- `getQuestionProgress()` - Progress calculation for visible questions only

### Phase 3: Enhanced LLM Extraction
**File Updated:**
- `app/onboarding-v2/lib/llm-extraction.ts`

**Strategy:**
1. Run keyword extraction first (fast, free, local)
2. If all confidence === 3 (perfect matches), use keywords directly
3. If confidence < 3, call LLM for refinement
4. LLM results always take priority over keywords
5. Detailed logging for debugging

**Benefits:**
- Reduced API costs (only call LLM when needed)
- Faster extraction for clear inputs
- Better accuracy overall

### Phase 5: Demo Mode Implementation
**Files Created:**
- `app/onboarding-v2/lib/demo-data.ts` - Complete "Denim Collective" demo contract

**Updates:**
- `app/onboarding-v2/types.ts` - Added `demoMode` to UI state
- `app/onboarding-v2/store/onboardingStore.ts` - Added `setDemoMode()` action
- `app/onboarding-v2/components/OnboardingFooter.tsx` - Demo mode toggle button

**Demo Data:**
- Company: "Denim Collective"
- Location: Istanbul, Turkey
- Size: 45 employees, 2 production lines
- Capacity: 10,000 garments/month
- Products: Jeans, Jackets, Shirts, Shorts
- Full team structure, floor plan, metrics
- Ready for instant 30-second walkthrough

### Phase 7: Enhanced Generation Animation
**File Updated:**
- `app/onboarding-v2/components/GenerationModal.tsx`

**Industry-Specific Stages:**
- **Manufacturing**: Data Model → Items & SKUs → Production Lines → Teams → Floor Plan → Analytics → Complete

- Company name, logo, size, facilities
- Review and final confirmation

**Manufacturing Questions:**
- Sub-industry (fashion vs general)
- Business intro with enrichment
- Products, production model, capacity, shifts
- Seasonality, garment types, variants, collections
- Components, tracking level

## 🔄 What's Not Yet Wired Up

While all core components are built, they still need to be integrated into the main onboarding flow:

1. **Question Loader Integration**: Need to use `loadQuestionsForIndustry()` in main page
2. **Question Engine Integration**: Need to use `shouldShowQuestion()` filtering in main page
3. **Demo Mode Data Population**: Need to auto-fill questions when demo mode is on
4. **Demo Mode Banner**: Need to show banner when demo mode is active
5. **Enhanced Review Page**: Need to build beautiful sectioned contract display
6. **New Input Components**: Need to wire up `DynamicListInput` and `EnrichedTextInput` in StepContainer

## 📝 Integration Tasks Remaining

### Task 1: Update Main Onboarding Page
**File:** `app/onboarding-v2/page.tsx`
- Import `loadQuestionsForIndustry` and reload questions when industry changes
- Use `shouldShowQuestion` for filtering
- Handle demo mode data population
- Show demo mode banner when active

### Task 2: Update StepContainer
**File:** `app/onboarding-v2/components/StepContainer.tsx`
- Add support for `dynamic_list` question type → use `DynamicListInput`
- Add support for `enriched_text` question type → use `EnrichedTextInput`
- Wire up demo mode auto-fill

### Task 3: Enhanced Review Page
**File:** `app/onboarding-v2/components/ReviewPage.tsx`
- Create beautiful sectioned display
- Show completeness indicators
- Industry-specific sections
- Edit buttons that jump back to sections

### Task 4: Testing
- Test all 3 industries end-to-end
- Test demo mode population
- Test question skipping logic
- Test enrichment flow
- Test generation animation for each industry

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Wire up question loader in main page (30 min)
2. Integrate question engine filtering (30 min)
3. Add demo mode data population (45 min)
4. Build enhanced review page (2 hours)
5. Add new input type support to StepContainer (1 hour)
6. Testing and refinement (2 hours)

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 6-7 hours

## 💡 Technical Highlights
