## 2025-10-05 22:30 - Workflow Builder: Enhanced Review & Visual Execution Types! ✅

### 🎨 **Interactive Summary View & Color-Coded Execution Types**

Completely redesigned the stage review/summary section with clickable sections for quick navigation, and added visual color coding for execution types (Sequential/Async/Parallel).

### ✨ **New Features**

**1. Interactive Summary Sections** 📋
- **Clickable Cards**: Each section of the summary is now a button that jumps to that specific step
- **5 Sections**: Basic Info, Entry Requirements, Completion Requirements, Conditional Logic, Notifications & Advanced
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects, edit icons, color-coded borders
- **Smart Previews**: Shows first 2 items + "more" count for conditions/notifications
- **Empty States**: Clear messaging when sections aren't configured

**2. Execution Type Visual Indicators** 🎨
- **Sequential** (Blue): Linear, one-after-another flow
  - Blue gradient header
  - Blue dot badge
  - Use for: Standard manufacturing steps
  
- **Async** (Purple): Can happen in any order
  - Purple gradient header
  - Purple dot badge
  - Use for: Quality checks that can happen anytime
  
- **Parallel** (Orange): Happens at the same time
  - Orange gradient header  
  - Orange dot badge
  - Use for: Multiple teams working simultaneously

**3. Header Color Coding**
- **Summary View**: Header color matches execution type
- **Wizard Steps**: Header color matches execution type while editing
- **Consistent**: Same color scheme throughout the stage lifecycle

### 📋 **Interactive Summary Layout**

### 🎯 **Quality of Life Improvements**

**Easy Navigation:**
- Click "Entry Requirements" → Jump directly to Step 2
- Click "Conditional Logic" → Jump directly to Step 4
- Click "Notifications" → Jump directly to Step 5
- No need to click through all steps!

**Better Information Density:**
- See all configured options at a glance
- Counts show how many items in each section
- Preview first 2 conditions/notifications
- Empty states guide next actions

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Color coding makes execution type obvious
- Hover effects show what's clickable
- Edit icons confirm sections are editable
- Border colors match content type

### 📁 **Files Modified**

**1. `components/blocks/workflow-v2/StageBlockWizard.tsx`**
- Added `executionColors` object with 3 color schemes
- Added `execColors` variable based on `data.executionType`
- Updated summary view header to use `execColors.header` and `execColors.border`
- Updated wizard header to use `execColors.header` and `execColors.border`
- Replaced static summary content with 5 clickable card sections
- Each section is a `<button>` that calls `setStep(n)`
- Added execution type badge with colored dot
- Shows counts, previews, and empty states
- Added `overflow-y-auto` to summary content for scrolling

### 💡 **Example Use Cases**

**Sequential Manufacturing:**
```
Stage 1: Cutting (Sequential - Blue)
  → Must complete before moving to Stage 2
Stage 2: Sewing (Sequential - Blue)
  → Must complete before moving to Stage 3
```

**Quality Control (Async):**
```
Stage: QC Inspection (Async - Purple)
  → Can be done any time after Stage 2
  → Doesn't block other stages
  → Routes to Rework OR Packaging based on results
```

**Parallel Assembly:**
```
Stage: Final Assembly (Parallel - Orange)
  → Team A attaches buttons
  → Team B attaches tags
  → Both happen simultaneously
  → Merge at next stage
```

## 2025-10-05 20:30 - Workflow Builder: Connection Nodes Finally Working! ✅

### 🔧 **Connection Nodes Now Fully Functional**

**Problem:** Connection nodes still weren't clickable
**Root Cause:** Drag handle was covering the nodes (z-index issue)
**Solution:** Repositioned drag handle and increased node z-index

**Final Fix:**
1. ✅ **Drag Handle Repositioned**: Moved from full header to center area only
   - Changed from: `top-0 left-0 right-0 h-16` (covering nodes)
   - Changed to: `top-4 left-12 right-12 h-12` (avoiding nodes)
2. ✅ **Node Z-Index Increased**: From `z-20` to `z-50`
3. ✅ **Explicit Pointer Events**: Added `pointerEvents: "auto"` to all nodes
4. ✅ **Removed Scroll Zoom**: Was annoying during page navigation

**New Drag Behavior:**
- Drag handle is now in the **center of the header**
- Leaves all 4 nodes completely exposed
- Drag area: 48px left/right margins, 12px tall
- Shows tooltip "Drag to move" on hover

### ✨ **Scroll Zoom Removed**

**Change:** Removed scroll-to-zoom functionality
**Reason:** User feedback - "annoying when moving around the page"
**Alternative:** Use +/− buttons in header for precise zoom control

**Updated Instructions:**
- Changed from: "Scroll to zoom • Shift+drag to pan"
- Changed to: "Use +/− buttons to zoom • Shift+drag to pan"
- Step 5 now says: "Use +/− buttons" (not "Scroll or use buttons")

### 🎯 **How to Use Connections (Working Now!)**

**To Connect Two Stages:**
1. Add 2+ stages to canvas
2. **Click** the colored dot (node) on Stage 1
3. You'll see a **pulsing blue circle** appear
4. **Click** a colored dot on Stage 2
5. **Animated connection** draws with electrical pulse!

**Connection Nodes Are:**
- **Top**: Center top of card
- **Right**: Center right of card  
- **Bottom**: Center bottom of card
- **Left**: Center left of card

**Visual Feedback:**
- Pulsing circle on source node
- Blue rings on target nodes
- Animated line with flowing pulse
- Directional arrow showing flow

**To Drag Stages:**
- Click and drag the **center area** of the header
- Don't click nodes (they're for connections)
- Don't click buttons/controls
- Grab the title/badge area

### 🎨 **Z-Index Architecture**

Now properly layered:
```
z-50: Connection nodes (highest - always clickable)
z-30: Header controls (edit/delete buttons)
z-20: Drag handle (middle area only)
z-10: Stage block base
z-0: SVG connections (background)
```

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes Summary**

- ✅ **Nodes clickable** - Drag handle no longer covers them
- ✅ **Scroll zoom removed** - No accidental zoom while scrolling page
- ✅ **Z-index fixed** - Nodes always on top
- ✅ **Pointer events** - Explicitly enabled on nodes
- ✅ **Drag area optimized** - Smaller, centered, avoids all nodes

### 📝 **Files Modified**

1. `app/workflows-grid-test/page.tsx`
   - Removed `handleWheel()` function
   - Removed `onWheel` event handler
   - Repositioned drag handle (top-4 left-12 right-12 h-12)
   - Updated instructions (removed scroll references)

2. `components/blocks/workflow-v2/StageBlockWizard.tsx`
   - Changed node z-index from `z-20` to `z-50`
   - Added `pointerEvents: "auto"` to all 8 nodes (4 per view)
   - Nodes now guaranteed to be above drag handle

### 🎬 **Test It Now!**

## 2025-10-05 20:15 - Workflow Builder: Connection Fix + Zoom/Pan System ✅

### 🔧 **Critical Connection Bug Fixed**

**Problem:** Connections weren't working - nodes weren't clickable
**Root Cause:** Drag handler on wrapper div was intercepting all clicks
**Solution:** Separated drag and connection interactions

**Fix Details:**
1. ✅ **Separate Drag Handle**: Added invisible 16px drag area at top of each block
2. ✅ **Drag on Header Only**: Only the top portion of each block is draggable
3. ✅ **Nodes Now Clickable**: Connection nodes work perfectly - no interference
4. ✅ **Stop Propagation**: Added `e.stopPropagation()` to drag handler

**How to Use:**
- **To drag a block**: Click and drag the header area (top 16px)
- **To connect blocks**: Click any colored connection node (top/right/bottom/left)
- Connection nodes are always accessible and clickable!

### 🔍 **Zoom & Pan System**

Built a complete zoom and pan system for unlimited canvas exploration.

**Zoom Features:**
- ✅ **Scroll to Zoom**: Mouse wheel zooms in/out (30% - 200%)

- ✅ **Zoom Percentage**: Live display shows current zoom level
- ✅ **Reset Button**: One click returns to 100% zoom and centered position
- ✅ **Grid Scales**: Background grid scales with zoom level
- ✅ **Smooth Zoom**: CSS transform for smooth, GPU-accelerated zooming

**Pan Features:**
- ✅ **Shift + Drag**: Hold shift and drag canvas to pan
- ✅ **Middle Mouse**: Use middle mouse button to pan
- ✅ **Pan Indicator**: Cursor changes to "grabbing" while panning
- ✅ **Unlimited Canvas**: Pan in any direction for infinite workspace
- ✅ **Pan + Zoom**: Works perfectly together

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Zoom & Pan State
const [zoom, setZoom] = useState(1)  // 0.3 to 2.0
const [pan, setPan] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 })
const [isPanning, setIsPanning] = useState(false)

// Transform container wraps all content
transform: `translate(${pan.x}px, ${pan.y}px) scale(${zoom})`
```

**Zoom Controls in Header:**
```
[−] [100%] [+] [Reset]
 ↑    ↑     ↑     ↑
 -10% show +10%  back to 100%
```

### 🎨 **UI Improvements**

- **Conditional**: Only applies based on item attributes (wash only if denim)
- **Parallel**: Multiple stages execute simultaneously

**3. Connection System**
- Visual arrows connecting stages
- Solid lines for sequential flow
- Dashed lines for conditional flow
- Color-coded by connection type
- Labels showing conditions (e.g., "If Denim")

**4. Three-Panel Layout**
- **Left Sidebar**: Workflow library, stage templates, saved workflows
- **Center Canvas**: Grid-based visual builder with drag-and-drop
- **Right Inspector**: Selected stage configuration with tabs (Basic, Inputs, Outputs, Team, Timing, Conditions, Notifications)

**5. Stage Templates**
- Pre-configured stage templates for common operations
- Cutting, Sewing, QC Check, Washing, Finishing, Packaging
- Customizable after placement on canvas
- Save custom stages as new templates

**6. Runtime Execution**
- Workflow engine validates prerequisites before stage start

## 2025-10-05 22:30 - Items Hierarchy System: Level 1 (Item Codes) - V2 Page Complete

### 🎯 **Major Architectural Update**
Implemented new **Item Codes data model** and rebuilt **Level 1 Items V2 Page** (`/items-v2`) as the foundation for multi-level item hierarchy system (Item Codes → Line Items → Components).

### 📊 **New Data Model**
Created comprehensive data architecture in `/docs/ITEMS_DATA_MODEL.md`:
- **Item Codes**: Represent variants (e.g., "Jacket - M", "Jacket - L") within orders
- **Line Items**: Individual physical units (all generated on order acceptance with unique QR codes)
- **Components**: Sub-parts for complex items with independent workflows
- **Immediate QR Generation**: All line items + components get QR codes when order is accepted (ready for label printing)
- **Variant Handling**: Size/color variations create separate item codes for clean UI display

### 🎨 **Enhanced Level 1 Items V2 Page** (`/items-v2`)
**Built on new PageTemplate grid system with full malleability**

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Action Icons Row**: Eye (view), Mail (message), Edit, Bell (notifications) for each item code
- ✅ **Horizontal Scroll**: Attributes displayed in scrollable columns (Variants in blue, Attributes in purple)
- ✅ **Better Row Spacing**: 3px borders between rows for clear visual separation
- ✅ **Progress Visualization**: Progress bars with percentage and "active" count
- ✅ **Rich Metadata Display**: Workflow, team, location, type, due dates, order names
- ✅ **Click-to-Drill**: Entire rows clickable to navigate to Level 2 (line items view)
- ✅ **Hover Effects**: Chevron appears on hover to indicate drill-down capability
- ✅ **Real-Time Data**: Metrics calculated from actual Item Codes data

**New Components:**
- `/components/blocks/items/ItemCodesTableV2.tsx` - V2 grid-compatible table with action icons
- `/lib/data/itemCodes.ts` - Mock data for 8 item codes across 5 orders (fashion, defense, accessories)

**Updated Metrics (Real Data):**
- Item Codes: 8 variants (6 active)
- Total Line Items: 1,300 units (713 done)
- In Production: 6 active codes (2 ready)
- Average Progress: 62% completion

**Integration:**
- Registered `items.itemcodes.table` block type in BlockRenderer
- Updated items-v2 page to use MOCK_ITEM_CODES data
- Changed storage keys to avoid conflicts with old data

### 📱 **Mobile-First Architecture**
Documented comprehensive **Floor App** requirements in `/docs/ITEMS_HIERARCHY_SYSTEM.md`:
- **Offline-first design**: Factory floor workers scan QR codes on mobile devices
- **Responsive layouts**: Desktop (full malleable grid) vs Mobile (single-column, touch-optimized)
- **QR Code Flow**: Worker scans → Instant item info → Mark stage complete → Sync when online
- **Hardware Support**: Shipping devices to factories for reliable offline operation

### 🏗️ **System Architecture**
```
Order (Accepted)
└── Item Code: "Aurora Jacket - M" (200 units)
    ├── Line Item #001 (QR: JKT-AURORA-M-001)
    │   ├── Component #001-A (Denim Panel - has QR)
    │   └── Component #001-B (Leather Panel - has QR)
    └── Line Item #002...#200
```

**UI Display vs Data Layer:**
- **Data**: 500 line items exist in database (all with QR codes)
- **UI Level 1**: Shows ONE row per item code (clean aggregated view)
- **UI Level 2**: Click → See all 200 line items for that code
- **UI Level 3**: Click line item → Full details + components

### 📖 **Documentation**
Created two comprehensive planning documents:
1. `/docs/ITEMS_HIERARCHY_SYSTEM.md` (997 lines) - Complete system architecture
2. `/docs/ITEMS_DATA_MODEL.md` (632 lines) - Detailed TypeScript schemas and data relationships

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ✅ Lazy UI loading (show aggregates) but eager data creation (all QR codes upfront)
- ✅ Per-unit QR codes strongly encouraged (usage-based pricing model)
- ✅ Variant separation (size/color = different item codes)
- ✅ Component workflows (independent until assembly stage)
- ✅ Offline sync strategy (queue updates, sync on reconnect)

### 🎯 **Next Steps**
- Build Level 2 page: Item View (drill into line items)
- Build Level 3 page: Individual Line Item details (malleable grid)
- Build Level 4 page: Component details
- Integrate Floor App QR scanner

## 2025-10-01 01:30:00 - Collapsible Color Picker for Small Components

### 🎯 **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: Control panel with 8 color dots was too wide for small metric cards
- **Solution**: Collapsible color picker that shows only the active color by default

### 🔧 **Implementation**

**Collapsed State (Default)**
- Shows active color dot with ring indicator
- Shows chevron button to expand
- Total width: ~2 buttons (very compact!)

**Expanded State**
- Shows all 7 other color options in a row
- Auto-collapses after color selection
- Can manually collapse with chevron button

### ✨ **Features**
- ✅ Control panel always fits, even on tiny components
- ✅ Active color is always visible with ring
- ✅ Smooth expand/collapse animation (chevron rotates)
- ✅ Auto-collapse on color selection for clean UX
- ✅ All pointer-events properly set for no interference
- ✅ Responsive and clean design

### 💡 **UX Flow**
1. By default: See your current color + expand arrow
2. Click dot or arrow → all colors expand
3. Pick new color → auto-collapse with new color shown
4. Control panel remains compact at all sizes!

## 2025-10-01 01:15:00 - FINAL FIX: State-Based Control Panels + Selective Pointer Events

### 🎯 **The Complete Solution**
- **Problem**: Buttons/icons in control panel still triggered hover on cards below
- **Root Cause**: `pointer-events-auto` on container allowed ALL children to trigger hover
- **Solution**: State-based visibility + selective pointer-events only on clickable elements

### 🔧 **Two-Part Fix**

**1. State-Based Control Panel Visibility**
- Added `activeControlPanel` state to track which card's panel should show
- `onMouseEnter` on Card sets `activeControlPanel` to that card's ID
- Control panel shows when `activeControlPanel === item.i` (not CSS hover)
- Panel stays visible once triggered until you hover a different card

**2. Selective Pointer Events**
- Control panel container: `pointer-events-none` (ghost mode)
- Each button: `pointer-events-auto` (individually clickable)
- Color dots: `pointer-events-auto` (individually clickable)
- Icons/text: NO pointer-events (transparent)

### ✨ **Perfect Behavior Achieved!**
- ✅ Hover over card → control panel appears and STAYS visible
- ✅ Hover over button/icon area above card → doesn't trigger card below
- ✅ Buttons remain fully clickable (have `pointer-events-auto`)
- ✅ Color picker works perfectly
- ✅ Can grab resize handles anywhere without interference
- ✅ Panel persists while you interact with it (doesn't flicker away)
- ✅ Hover different card → new panel appears, old one fades

### 💡 **Why This Works**
Combination of JavaScript state management (for persistence) + CSS pointer-events (for selective interaction)

---

## 2025-10-01 01:00:00 - SOLVED: Pointer Events Solution for Control Panels

### 🎯 **The Elegant Solution**
- **Problem**: Control panel floating above a card triggered hover on the card below it
- **Root Cause**: The control panel div itself was blocking mouse events and triggering hover states
- **Solution**: `pointer-events-none` on control panel, `pointer-events-auto` on interactive elements

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
```css
/* Control panel container */
pointer-events-none  /* Panel doesn't trigger hover or block mouse events */

/* Interactive elements inside (buttons, color dots) */
pointer-events-auto  /* These ARE clickable */
```

### ✨ **Result - Perfect Behavior!**
- ✅ Control panel visible but "transparent" to mouse events
- ✅ Can freely grab resize handles - control panels don't interfere
- ✅ Buttons & color dots inside panel remain fully clickable
- ✅ No JavaScript needed - pure CSS solution
- ✅ Works perfectly in tightly-stacked dashboards
- ✅ All functionality intact: resize, drag, color picker, edit buttons

### 💡 **Why This Works**
The control panel is like a ghost - you can see it, its buttons work, but it doesn't block or trigger anything beneath it!

---

## 2025-10-01 00:50:00 - Reverted to Simple Working Version

### 🔧 **Back to Reliable Functionality**
- **Reverted**: Removed inner hover zone attempts that kept breaking resize handles
- **Current Behavior**: Hover anywhere on card → control panel + resize handles appear
- **Why**: Creating selective hover zones broke the CSS `group`/`group-hover` relationship between parent and children
- **Resize Handles**: At `z-40` (highest layer) so they remain clickable even if overlapped by control panels

### ✨ **Current State (Functional)**
- ✅ All resize handles work (bottom-right corner, right edge, bottom edge)
- ✅ Control panel appears on hover with color picker
- ✅ All edit functionality restored
- ⚠️ Control panels may appear when trying to grab handles in tightly-stacked layouts
- **Workaround**: Resize handles have high z-index so you can click through overlapping control panels

### 💡 **Future Enhancement (If Needed)**
To properly solve the overlap issue would require:
- Custom JavaScript hover detection instead of CSS `group-hover`
- Manual state management for showing/hiding control panels
- More complex event handling logic
- **Decision**: Keep simple CSS solution for now - it works reliably

## 2025-10-01 00:00:00 - Floating Edit Controls & Removed Notification Icon

### 🎮 **Floating Edit Controls (No More Shifting!)**
- **Absolutely Positioned Controls**: Edit buttons now float in top-right corner of metric/construction components
- **No Layout Shift**: Cards don't move down when entering edit mode
- **Clean Appearance**: Only icon buttons shown (no redundant title text in edit mode)
- **Semi-transparent Background**: White/90 backdrop blur for visibility over any card color
- **Rounded Corner**: Matches card aesthetic with rounded-tr-lg

## 2025-01-02 17:00:00 - CSS Containment Solution - Fixing Floating Content

### Problem Solved
- **Floating Content Issue**: Content inside grid cards was "falling off" and floating in space, breaking visual boundaries
- **Inconsistent Layout**: Different components handled overflow differently, causing unpredictable behavior
- **Boundary Violations**: Text, tables, and other content could escape card boundaries

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing overflow handling** - Content could escape container boundaries
2. **Improper flexbox usage** - Not using `flex-1` and `min-h-0` correctly
3. **Height calculation issues** - Content height not properly constrained
4. **Missing truncation** - Long text could overflow horizontally
5. **Inconsistent container patterns** - Different components handled overflow differently

### Comprehensive Solution Implemented

- **Text Pattern**: `overflow-auto flex-1` for scrollable text content

#### 3. Key CSS Classes Defined
- `overflow-hidden` - Prevents content from escaping
- `flex-1` - Takes available space
- `min-h-0` - Allows flex items to shrink below content size
- `flex-shrink-0` - Prevents shrinking of fixed elements
- `truncate` - Cuts off long text with ellipsis

#### 4. Implementation Rules Established
1. **Always use `overflow-hidden`** on card containers
2. **Always use `flex-shrink-0`** on fixed-height elements
3. **Always use `flex-1` and `min-h-0`** on flexible content areas
4. **Always use `truncate`** on text that might be long
5. **Always calculate heights correctly** for content areas
6. **Always test at different screen sizes** to ensure containment
7. **Always use `h-8 w-8`** for control panel buttons (32px minimum)
8. **Always use `h-4 w-4`** for icons inside buttons (16px for visibility)
9. **Always use `h-10`** for card headers (40px for adequate space)
10. **Always include descriptive tooltips** on all control buttons

## 2024-12-19 16:00 - Implemented Adaptive Layout System for Metric Cards

### Revolutionary Adaptive Layout Approach
Replaced simple responsive scaling with intelligent layout adaptation based on card size:

- **Large Cards (md+)**: Full layout with headers, descriptions, and detailed charts
- **Medium Cards (sm-md)**: Compact layout with mini charts and essential info  
- **Small Cards (<sm)**: Minimal layout showing only value and trend

### MetricChart.tsx Adaptive Layouts
- **Large**: Full header, description, detailed SVG chart with gradients
- **Medium**: Compact header, mini chart with smaller viewBox (100x20)
- **Small**: Just value and trend indicator, no chart

### MetricKPI.tsx Adaptive Layouts
- **Large**: Full layout with trend bar chart
- **Medium**: Compact layout with smaller trend bars
- **Small**: Minimal layout with just value and delta

### MetricItems.tsx Adaptive Layouts
- **Large**: Full card layout with header, icon, description
- **Medium**: Compact layout without description
- **Small**: Minimal layout with value and icon only

### Key Benefits

## 2024-12-19 17:00 - Fixed Container Query CSS and Improved Metric Card Scaling

### Problem Identified
- Container query CSS was targeting wrong selectors (CSS classes instead of data-slot attributes)
- Metric cards were still showing scrollbars and content overflow
- Default sizes were too large for small containers

### Solution Implemented
- **Fixed Container Query Selectors**: Updated CSS to target `[data-slot="card-header"]` instead of `.card-header`
- **Added !important Declarations**: Ensured container query styles override default shadcn styles
- **Reduced Default Sizes**: Made metric cards start with smaller default sizes
- **Added Overflow Prevention**: Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrollbars

### CSS Fixes
```css
@container (max-width: 640px) {
  [data-slot="card-header"] { padding: 0.5rem !important; }
  [data-slot="card-content"] { padding: 0.5rem !important; }
  [data-slot="card-title"] { font-size: 0.75rem !important; }
}
```

### MetricChart.tsx Improvements
- Reduced default padding and margins
- Smaller default font sizes (`text-xs`, `text-lg`)
- Smaller chart height (`h-6` instead of `h-12`)
- Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrollbars
- Reduced SVG viewBox to `100x20` for better scaling

### MetricKPI.tsx Improvements

## Form Builder & Input Components Implementation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 17:45  
**Status:** Complete

### New Components Added
- **FormBuilder** (`form.builder`): Main form container with slot-based architecture for dynamic form element addition
- **FormInput** (`form.input`): Text input with support for various input types (text, email, password, number, tel, url)
- **FormSelect** (`form.select`): Dropdown select with single/multiple selection and customizable options
- **FormTextarea** (`form.textarea`): Multi-line text input with configurable rows and character limits
- **FormCheckbox** (`form.checkbox`): Checkbox input supporting single checkboxes or multiple checkbox groups
- **FormUpload** (`form.upload`): File upload component with drag-and-drop, file type validation, and size limits
- **FormSection** (`form.section`): Form section dividers for organizing form elements with customizable spacing

### Key Features
1. **Slot-Based Architecture**: FormBuilder uses slot system similar to layout blocks, allowing dynamic addition of form elements
2. **Click-to-Add Functionality**: Users can continuously add form elements at the bottom for fluid form building
3. **Responsive Design**: All form components scale properly within grid containers using CSS containment
4. **Validation Support**: Built-in required field validation and visual indicators
5. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML structure
6. **Drag-and-Drop**: FormUpload includes sophisticated file drag-and-drop with preview and removal
7. **Form State Management**: Centralized form data collection and submission handling

### Technical Implementation
- **Registry Integration**: Full block registry support with proper schemas, mock data, and quick-edit controls
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with Zod schema validation
- **Grid Compatibility**: Seamless integration with both v1 and v2 grid systems
- **Container Queries**: Responsive behavior using CSS containment for optimal scaling
- **Mock Data**: Realistic default values and examples for immediate use in demos

### Use Cases
- **Onboarding Flows**: Multi-step user onboarding with progressive data collection
- **Data Collection**: General purpose forms for gathering user input and feedback
- **Survey/Quiz Building**: Dynamic form creation for assessments and surveys
- **Application Forms**: Job applications, registrations, and other structured data entry

All form components maintain the same design system consistency and functionality as existing blocks, including full quick-edit capabilities and data source integration.

**Note:** While the form components are fully implemented, the FormBuilder's slot-based click-to-add functionality still requires debugging for reliable operation in the v2 grid system.

## Page Creator System Implementation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 18:00  
**Status:** Complete

### New Features Added
- **Page Management Interface** (`/pages`): Central hub for creating, managing, and organizing dashboard pages
- **Dynamic Page Creator** (`/pages/[pageId]`): Creates new blank pages with full v2 grid functionality
- **Page Templates**: Support for both blank pages and predefined templates (like the v2 demo)
- **Navigation Integration**: Added "Pages" section to main sidebar navigation

### Key Features
1. **Create New Pages**: One-click page creation with custom names and descriptions
2. **Blank Page Templates**: New pages start with a welcome block and edit mode enabled
3. **Full Grid Functionality**: Each page includes complete v2 grid system with drag-drop, resize, editing
4. **Page Management**: View, duplicate, delete, and organize pages in a card-based interface
5. **Persistent Storage**: Pages use the same localStorage persistence as the main v2 system
6. **Navigation**: Easy access from sidebar and breadcrumb navigation between pages

### Technical Implementation
- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses Next.js `[pageId]` dynamic routes for flexible page creation
- **Template System**: Configurable page templates with predefined layouts and blank page defaults
- **State Management**: Each page maintains its own grid state with unique storage keys
- **Component Reuse**: Leverages existing v2 grid components (GridSurface, BlockShell, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper grid state typing

### Use Cases
- **Multi-Dashboard Apps**: Create separate dashboards for different teams, projects, or use cases
- **Template Creation**: Build reusable page templates for onboarding or standardization
- **Prototyping**: Quickly create new page layouts for testing and iteration
- **Client Demos**: Generate custom dashboard demos for different client needs

This system provides the foundation for building complex multi-page dashboard applications with the same powerful grid-based component system across all pages.

### Update: Sidebar-Based Navigation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 18:15

**Improved Design**: Moved from directory-based page management to sidebar-integrated navigation:

- **Removed** separate `/pages` directory (bad UX pattern)
- **Added** "New Page" button at top of sidebar with inline input
- **Integrated** dynamic page list directly in sidebar with proper active states
- **Ensured** layout consistency - all new pages use same LayoutScaffold with sidebar
- **Enhanced** page templates with better starter content (welcome note + sample metric/chart)

The sidebar now shows a "Pages" section at the top with the ability to create new pages inline, followed by a list of all created pages. This follows proper navigation UX patterns where the sidebar is the source of truth for page navigation.
