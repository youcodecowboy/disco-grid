## 2025-10-14 - Playbooks System: Task Automation Engine ‚ö°

### üöÄ **New Feature: Playbooks - Automated Task Creation**

Introduced the Playbooks system, a powerful automation layer that sits between workflows and tasks, eliminating manual task creation for predictable, repeatable factory operations.

**Core Concept:**
- **Playbooks**: Reusable automation templates (e.g., "Order Acceptance Playbook", "Cutting Stage Playbook")
- **Plays**: Individual automation rules within a playbook that define triggers and task templates
- **Triggers**: Events that activate plays (workflow stages, task completion, dates, capacity, etc.)
- **Automation**: Tasks automatically created in tasks-v2 system when trigger conditions are met

**Key Features:**

**8 Trigger Types:**
1. **Workflow Stage Change** - When items enter/exit/complete workflow stages
2. **Task Completion** - When specific tasks are completed
3. **Order Accepted** - When orders are accepted
4. **Order Completed** - When orders are fully completed
5. **Date-Based** - Specific dates or relative to order dates (e.g., "+3 days after acceptance")
6. **Time-Based** - Recurring schedules (daily/weekly/monthly)
7. **Capacity-Based** - When team capacity crosses thresholds
8. **Previous Order Completion** - When previous orders complete

**Assignment Flexibility:**
- Assign to specific people (multi-select with avatars)
- Assign to roles (resolved at runtime: "Pattern Maker", "QC Inspector")
- Assign to teams (all team members receive task)

**Smart Dependencies:**
- Plays can depend on other plays within same playbook
- Tasks wait for dependencies before triggering
- Maintains proper sequencing (e.g., "Print patterns" waits for "Finalize pattern")

**UI/UX:**

**Playbooks Index (`/playbooks`):**
- Grid of playbook cards with status indicators
- Active/inactive toggle per playbook
- Play count and last modified date
- Empty state with onboarding
- Quick navigation to builder

**Playbook Builder (`/playbooks/[id]`):**
- Lego-style document layout (centered, minimal by default)
- Inline editable playbook name and description
- Play cards stack vertically with "+ Add play" button
- Each play card is collapsible/expandable
- Drag handles hint at future reordering

**Play Card Components:**
- **Trigger Builder**: Dynamic form based on selected trigger type
- **Task Details**: Title, description (optional), priority, duration
- **Assignment Picker**: Toggle between specific people vs role/team
- **Dependencies**: Select other plays as prerequisites
- **Enable/Disable**: Per-play activation switch

**Implementation Details:**

**Files Created:**
```
lib/playbooks/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts              # Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mockData.ts           # 3 example playbooks with realistic plays

docs/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playbooks-system.md   # Complete system documentation
```

**Integration with Tasks v2:**
- Tasks created with `source: "automation"`
- Full traceability via context metadata (playbookId, playId, trigger info)
- Uses existing Task/TaskCreationInput types
- Assignment resolution at runtime (roles ‚Üí actual users)
- Dependencies mapped to task dependencies

**Mock Examples:**

**Order Acceptance Playbook:**
- Order fabric from supplier (trigger: order accepted)
- Order trims and accessories (trigger: order accepted)
- Finalize and grade pattern (trigger: order accepted)
- Print patterns (trigger: "finalize pattern" task completes)
- Schedule fabric inspection (trigger: 3 days after order accepted)

**Cutting Stage Playbook:**
- Change thread color (trigger: enters "Cutting" stage)
- Rest fabric for 24 hours (trigger: enters "Cutting" stage)
- Perform shrinkage test (trigger: enters "Cutting" stage)
- Lay fabric on table (trigger: "rest fabric" task completes)

**Weekly Maintenance Routines:**
- Machine maintenance check (trigger: every Monday 7am)
- Cutting table calibration (trigger: every Wednesday 8am)

**Technical Architecture:**

**Trigger Execution** (Future Backend):
- Event-driven architecture with Convex
- Monitors workflow state transitions, task completions, order events
- Scheduled jobs for date/time-based triggers
- Capacity monitoring for threshold-based triggers

**Role/Team Resolution:**
- Specific people: Direct mapping to user IDs
- Teams: Query active team members at execution time
- Roles: Find users with matching role, optionally load-balance

**Traceability:**
```typescript
task.contexts = [{
  type: "custom",
  referenceId: playbookId,
  metadata: {
    playbookId, playbookName,
    playId, playTitle,
    triggeredBy: { type: "order_accepted", ... },
    triggeredAt: timestamp
  }
}]
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminates repetitive manual task creation
- ‚úÖ Ensures critical tasks are never forgotten
- ‚úÖ Standardizes factory processes
- ‚úÖ Reduces cognitive load on managers
- ‚úÖ Provides full audit trail of automated tasks
- ‚úÖ Flexible assignment strategies (people, roles, teams)
- ‚úÖ Smart dependency management
- ‚úÖ Easy to maintain and modify

**Navigation:**
- Added "Playbooks" to sidebar (Zap icon, between Tasks V2 and Reports)
- Route: `/playbooks`
- Reserved route name to prevent conflicts

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive `docs/playbooks-system.md` covering:
  - Problem statement and use cases
  - All 8 trigger types with examples
  - Integration with tasks-v2
  - Backend execution strategy
  - Role/team resolution logic

## 2025-10-15 - Order Builder V2: Smart Client Change Handling üîÑ

### üêõ **Bug Fix: Order Name Updates When Client Changes**

Fixed issue where changing the client after initial selection would leave the order name with the wrong client code, preventing misnamed orders.

**Issue:**
- Select "Horizon Apparel" ‚Üí Name becomes "HAC-2025-001" ‚úì
- Change to "Summit Fabrication" ‚Üí Name still shows "HAC-2025-001" ‚úó
- Could lead to orders named for the wrong client

**Solution:**
- Smart tracking of whether user has manually edited the name
- Auto-updates name when client changes (if not manually edited)
- Preserves custom names when user has typed their own
- Refresh button resets to auto-update mode

**Behavior:**

**Scenario 1 - No Manual Edits:**
```
1. Select "Horizon Apparel" ‚Üí HAC-2025-001 (auto)
2. Change to "Summit Fabrication" ‚Üí SFL-2025-001 (updates!)
3. Change to "Vertex Manufacturing" ‚Üí VMG-2025-001 (updates!)
```

**Scenario 2 - Manual Edit:**
```
1. Select "Horizon Apparel" ‚Üí HAC-2025-001 (auto)
2. Edit to "HAC-2025-001 - Spring Collection" (manual)
3. Change to "Summit Fabrication" ‚Üí Name stays "HAC-2025-001 - Spring Collection" (preserved)
4. Order number shows SFL-2025-001 but name is custom
```

**Scenario 3 - Refresh to Reset:**
```
1. Select client ‚Üí Auto name
2. Edit name manually ‚Üí Custom name preserved
3. Click refresh (‚Üª) ‚Üí Resets to auto-update mode
4. Change client ‚Üí Name updates again
```

**Technical Implementation:**

```tsx
// Track manual edits
const [hasManuallyEditedName, setHasManuallyEditedName] = useState(false)

// Auto-update on client change
useEffect(() => {
  if (orderInfo.client) {
    const newOrderNumber = generateOrderNumber(orderInfo.client)
    
    if (!hasManuallyEditedName) {
      // Update both number and name
      onChange({ orderNumber: newOrderNumber, name: newOrderNumber })
    } else {
      // Just update number, preserve custom name
      onChange({ orderNumber: newOrderNumber })
    }
  }
}, [orderInfo.client])

// Detect manual edits
<input
  onChange={(e) => {
    onChange({ name: e.target.value })
    setHasManuallyEditedName(true) // Flag set on edit
  }}
/>

// Refresh resets flag
<button onClick={() => {
  onChange({ orderNumber: newNumber, name: newNumber })
  setHasManuallyEditedName(false) // Back to auto mode
}}>
  ‚Üª
</button>
```

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- ‚úÖ New client creation ‚Üí Auto-generates name
- ‚úÖ Refresh button ‚Üí Resets to auto mode
- ‚úÖ Multiple client changes ‚Üí Updates each time (if not edited)
- ‚úÖ Manual edit ‚Üí Locks name, preserves user intent
- ‚úÖ Order number badge ‚Üí Always shows correct client code

**Why This Works:**
- Smart defaults prevent errors
- User intent is respected (manual edits preserved)
- Refresh provides escape hatch back to auto mode
- Order number and name can diverge if needed
- Clear visual feedback (order number updates even if name doesn't)

**Files Updated:**
- `app/orders/new-v2/steps/OrderInfoStep.tsx` - Smart name tracking

**User Feedback Addressed:**
> "If you change the client it does not update the name to reflect the change, this could be messy if people mis-click and end up naming orders for the wrong client"

Now the order name intelligently updates with client changes, preventing misnamed orders while still allowing customization when needed.

```

**Technical Implementation:**

```tsx
// State management
const [showNewClientModal, setShowNewClientModal] = useState(false)
const [customClients, setCustomClients] = useState<string[]>([])
const allClients = [...customClients, ...DEFAULT_CLIENTS]

// Handle creation
const handleNewClient = (clientInfo: ClientInfo) => {
  setCustomClients([clientInfo.name, ...customClients])
  onChange({ client: clientInfo.name }) // Auto-select
  console.log("New client created:", clientInfo) // Ready for API
}

// Client selector with special value
<Select onValueChange={(value) => {

## 2025-10-15 - Order Builder V2: Fixed Priority/Flag Dropdown Behavior üéØ

### üêõ **Bug Fix: Improved Dropdown Interaction**

Fixed hover state issues with Priority and Flag dropdowns by converting them from hover-based to click-based menus with proper backdrop handling.

**Issue:**
- Hover menus would disappear when moving mouse to menu items
- Gap between trigger and menu caused hover state to break
- Unreliable interaction - frustrating UX

**Solution:**
- Converted to click-based dropdowns with state management
- Added invisible backdrop to capture outside clicks
- Menu stays open until item selected or backdrop clicked
- Proper z-index layering (backdrop z-10, menu z-20)

**Technical Changes:**

```tsx
// Before: Hover-based (unreliable)
<div className="relative group">
  <button className="...">+ Priority</button>
  <div className="... hidden group-hover:block">
    {/* Menu disappears when mouse leaves button */}
  </div>
</div>

// After: Click-based with backdrop
const [showPriorityMenu, setShowPriorityMenu] = useState(false)

<div className="relative">
  <button onClick={() => setShowPriorityMenu(!showPriorityMenu)}>
    + Priority
  </button>
  {showPriorityMenu && (
    <>
      {/* Invisible backdrop closes menu */}
      <div className="fixed inset-0 z-10" onClick={() => setShowPriorityMenu(false)} />
      {/* Menu stays open */}
      <div className="absolute ... z-20">
        <button onClick={() => {
          onChange({ priority: value })
          setShowPriorityMenu(false) // Close on select
        }}>
          {option}
        </button>
      </div>
    </>
  )}
</div>
```

**What Changed:**
- **Priority dropdown**: Now click to open, click item or outside to close
- **Flag dropdown**: Same click-based behavior
- Added state management: `showPriorityMenu`, `showFlagMenu`
- Backdrop closes menu when clicking outside
- Menu closes automatically when item selected

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Reliable - no more disappearing menus
- ‚úÖ Expected behavior - click to open/close
- ‚úÖ Easy to use - menu stays open while selecting
- ‚úÖ Proper layering - backdrop prevents accidental clicks
- ‚úÖ Mobile-friendly - better for touch interfaces

**Files Updated:**
- `app/orders/new-v2/steps/OrderInfoStep.tsx` - Dropdown behavior

**User Feedback Addressed:**
> "The hit box seems off, so when i hover over the selection the menu appears, but when you move the mouse to the menu items they disappear most of the time"

Now the dropdowns work reliably with standard click-based interaction patterns.

## 2025-10-15 - Order Builder V2: Sticky Navigation Footer üìå

### üéØ **UX Enhancement: Always-Visible Navigation**

Made the wizard navigation footer sticky so users can navigate between steps without scrolling.

**What Changed:**

**Before:**
- Navigation buttons at bottom of content
- Had to scroll down to see Previous/Next buttons
- Could lose track of where you are in long forms

**After:**
- Navigation footer is **fixed to bottom of viewport**
- Always visible regardless of scroll position
- Floating shadow effect separates it from content
- Content has bottom padding to prevent overlap

**Visual Design:**
```

```

**Technical Implementation:**

```tsx
// Main content with bottom padding (prevents footer overlap)
<div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto py-6 pb-32 space-y-6">
  {/* Step content */}
</div>

// Sticky footer
<div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-white border-t border-slate-200 shadow-lg z-30">
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-4 flex items-center justify-between">
    {/* Navigation buttons */}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Styling Details:**
- `fixed bottom-0` - Sticks to bottom of viewport
- `left-0 right-0` - Full width
- `shadow-lg` - Elevated shadow for depth
- `border-t border-slate-200` - Subtle divider
- `z-30` - Floats above content
- `pb-32` on content - Prevents text from hiding under footer

**Why This Improves UX:**
- ‚úÖ No scrolling needed to navigate
- ‚úÖ Always know where you are in the wizard
- ‚úÖ Faster form completion
- ‚úÖ More professional feel
- ‚úÖ Context-aware buttons always accessible
- ‚úÖ Matches modern SaaS app patterns

**Files Updated:**
- `app/orders/new-v2/page.tsx` - Footer positioning and content padding

**User Feedback Addressed:**
> "Can we also now make the next/back selections a sticky footer, so they do not need to scroll in order to see the buttons?"

Now users can focus on form content without losing access to navigation controls.

## 2025-10-15 - Order Builder V2: Auto-Populate Order Name with Number üî¢

### ‚ú® **UX Enhancement: Smart Order Name Population**

Order name now auto-fills with the generated order number when a client is selected, reducing manual typing and ensuring consistent naming.

**What Changed:**

**Before:**
- Order number displayed above empty name field
- User had to manually type or copy the number

**After:**
- Order number automatically populates the name field
- Shown as: `HAC-2025-001` (both in label and input)
- User can edit/customize the name from there
- Refresh button (‚Üª) regenerates both number and name

**Behavior:**

1. **Select client** ‚Üí Order number generated ‚Üí Name field auto-populated
   - Example: Select "Horizon Apparel Co." ‚Üí Name becomes "HAC-2025-001"

2. **Click refresh (‚Üª)** ‚Üí New number generated ‚Üí Name field updated
   - Generates new sequence number
   - Updates both order number label and name input

3. **User can customize** ‚Üí Type over the auto-filled name
   - Default provides structure
   - Fully editable for custom naming

**Why This Improves UX:**
- ‚úÖ One less field to manually fill
- ‚úÖ Ensures systematic naming convention by default
- ‚úÖ Maintains consistency across orders
- ‚úÖ Still allows full customization when needed
- ‚úÖ Reduces cognitive load - smart defaults

**Technical Implementation:**

```tsx
// Auto-populate on client selection
useEffect(() => {
  if (orderInfo.client && !orderInfo.orderNumber) {
    const newOrderNumber = generateOrderNumber(orderInfo.client)
    onChange({ 
      orderNumber: newOrderNumber,
      // Auto-fill name if empty
      ...(orderInfo.name === "" && { name: newOrderNumber })
    })
  }
}, [orderInfo.client])

// Refresh button updates both
onClick={() => {
  const newOrderNumber = generateOrderNumber(orderInfo.client)
  onChange({ 
    orderNumber: newOrderNumber,
    name: newOrderNumber // Also update name
  })
}}
```

**Files Updated:**
- `app/orders/new-v2/steps/OrderInfoStep.tsx` - Auto-populate logic

**User Feedback Addressed:**
> "Can we have the title auto populate the suggested title not just show it above"

Now the order name field intelligently pre-fills with the systematic order number, making order creation even faster while maintaining flexibility.

## 2025-10-15 - Order Builder V2: Improved Item Navigation & Completion Flow ‚úÖ

### üéØ **UX Enhancement: Clearer Item-to-Review Flow**

Redesigned the navigation buttons on item steps to make it crystal clear that users can either add more items or proceed to complete the order.

**What Changed:**

**Before:**
- Single "Next" button (ambiguous)
- "Add Another Item" button (secondary action)
- Not clear that you could skip to review

**After - Context-Aware Navigation:**

**On Order Info Step:**
- Single button: **"Continue to Items"** (blue)

**On Each Item Step:**
- Two prominent buttons side-by-side:
  1. **"+ Add Another Item"** (outline, sky blue) - Adds new item and navigates to it
  2. **"Complete Order"** (solid, emerald green) - Jumps directly to Review & Calendar step

**On Review Step:**
- Single button: **"Submit Order"** (emerald green)

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
Item Page Bottom:

[‚Üê Previous]        [+ Add Another Item]  [Complete Order ‚Üí]
                    (outline, blue)        (solid, green)
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Clear choice: "Do I need more items or am I done?"
- ‚úÖ Color coding: Blue = continue, Green = finish
- ‚úÖ Equal visual weight = equal options
- ‚úÖ "Complete Order" directly jumps to review (skips empty item steps)
- ‚úÖ Both actions require valid current item (disabled if validation fails)

**Technical Implementation:**

```tsx
{wizard.stepType === "item" && (
  <>
    {/* Add more items */}
    <Button
      variant="outline"
      onClick={() => {
        wizard.addItem()
        wizard.goNext()
      }}
      disabled={!wizard.canProceed}
      className="rounded-full border-sky-200 text-sky-700 hover:bg-sky-50"
    >
      <Plus className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
      Add Another Item
    </Button>
    
    {/* Jump to review */}
    <Button
      onClick={() => wizard.goToStep(wizard.totalSteps - 1)}
      disabled={!wizard.canProceed}
      className="rounded-full bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 text-white"
    >
      Complete Order
      <ArrowRight className="ml-2 h-4 w-4" />
    </Button>
  </>
)}
```

**Files Updated:**
- `app/orders/new-v2/page.tsx` - Redesigned navigation per step type

**User Feedback Addressed:**
> "On the item page, instead of just clicking next, there needs to be an extra feature that basically says 'Add another item' or 'Complete order'."

This makes the multi-item flow intuitive and gives users full control over when they're done building items.

- Example: "Horizon Apparel Co." ‚Üí `HAC-2025-001`
- Client code extracted from company name (first letters of main words)
- Chronological sequence tracking
- Refresh button (‚Üª) to generate new number
- Displayed in monospace font with slate background

**2. Symbol/Emoji Picker (Notion-Style)**
- Click to open 40+ emoji library
- Categories: Packages, Business, Tech, Fashion, Furniture, Buildings
- One-click selection
- Remove option to clear icon
- Shows in order summary and review step

**3. Priority Tags (Color-Coded)**
- **Low**: Slate gray
- **Medium**: Blue
- **High**: Amber  
- **Urgent**: Rose red
- Hover dropdown to select
- Click to remove
- Persists to review step

**4. Custom Flags**
- Add unlimited custom tags
- Common presets: "Rush", "Export", "Prototype", "Custom", "Repeat Order", "Large Volume"
- Inline text input for custom flags
- Press Enter to add
- Click √ó to remove
- Displays with flag icon üö©

**Visual Layout:**
```
[Icon] [Order Number]
       [Order Name - Large Input]
       [Priority] [Flag] [Flag] [+ Flag]
```

**Technical Implementation:**

```tsx
// Auto-generate order number
function generateClientCode(clientName: string): string {
  const words = clientName.split(" ").filter(w => w.length > 2)
  return words.slice(0, 3).map(w => w[0].toUpperCase()).join("")
}

function generateOrderNumber(client: string): string {
  const clientCode = generateClientCode(client)
  const year = new Date().getFullYear()
  const sequence = getNextSequence(client) // Would query DB in production
  return `${clientCode}-${year}-${sequence.toString().padStart(3, "0")}`
}

// Type definition
type OrderInfo = {
  orderNumber?: string // HAC-2025-001
  symbol?: string // üì¶
  priority?: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "urgent"
  flags?: string[] // ["Rush", "Export"]
  // ... existing fields
}
```

**New Component:**
- `/components/orders-v2/EmojiPicker.tsx` - Notion-style emoji selector with 40+ icons

### ‚ú® **Enhancement: Smart Attribute Suggestions**

Made attribute suggestions dynamic, persistent, and encouraging.

**What Changed:**

**1. Persistent Suggestions**
- Suggestions now **always visible** (not just on first attribute)
- Header updates: "Suggested fields:" ‚Üí "More suggested fields:"
- Stays visible as long as unused suggestions remain

**2. Smart Filtering**
- Already-used attribute names automatically removed from suggestions
- Case-insensitive matching (e.g., "Material" filters "material")
- Pool updates after each attribute added

**3. Expanded Suggestion Pool**
- Combined all industry presets (Fashion, Construction, Defense, Electronics, Furniture)
- Now shows **8 suggestions at a time** (up from 6)
- 30+ total unique suggestions across industries
- Automatic duplicate removal

**4. Encouraging Message**
- New hint: *"üí° Add as many attributes as possible for the best item tracking and traceability"*
- Shows when attributes list is empty
- Motivates comprehensive metadata entry

**Example Flow:**
1. Start: "üí° Add as many..." + 8 suggestions (Material, Size, Color...)
2. Add "Material: Denim" ‚Üí "More suggested fields:" shows 8 NEW options
3. Add "Size: Large" ‚Üí Suggestions update again with fresh options
4. Continue until all options used

**Technical:**
```tsx
// Filter used fields
const usedFields = attributes.map(attr => attr.field.toLowerCase())
const availableSuggestions = presetSuggestions.filter(
  suggestion => !usedFields.includes(suggestion.toLowerCase())
)

// Combine all presets
const allSuggestions = VERTICAL_PRESETS.flatMap(preset => preset.defaultAttributes)
const uniqueSuggestions = Array.from(new Set(allSuggestions))
```

**Files Updated:**
- `/components/orders-v2/AttributeBuilder.tsx` - Dynamic filtering logic
- `/app/orders/new-v2/steps/ItemBuilderStep.tsx` - Combined preset pool

### üêõ **Bug Fix: Import Error Resolution**

**Issue:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`

**Root Cause:** `LOCATION_OPTIONS` constant not re-exported from `/lib/orders-v2/types.ts`

**Solution:** Added missing export:
```tsx
export { 
  WORKFLOW_LIBRARY, 
  CONTACT_DIRECTORY, 
  TEAM_DIRECTORY, 
  TRACEABILITY_COMPLIANCE_OPTIONS, 
  VERTICAL_PRESETS, 
  STANDARD_LABEL_FIELDS, 
  LOCATION_OPTIONS  // ‚Üê Added
} from "@/app/orders/new/types"
```

**4. Integration with Existing Keyword Matcher**
- Extended `MatchResult` interface to include:
  - `dataSource`: Detected data source with confidence
  - `entityContext`: Full context (action, time, metric)
  - `suggestedTitle`: Pre-generated contextual title
- Seamlessly integrates with component generation flow
- Backward compatible with existing prompts

### üìä **Example Improvements**

**Before:**
- Prompt: "make me a table of active customers"
- Title: "Data Table" 
- Columns: Generic "Name", "Value", "Status", "Date"
- Data: "Item 1", "Item 2", etc.

**After:**
- Prompt: "make me a table of active customers"
- Title: "Active Customers"
- Columns: "Name", "Email", "Company", "Status", "Lifetime Value"
- Data: "Sarah Johnson", "sarah.johnson@example.com", "Acme Corp", "active", "$32,450"

### üé® **Better Demo Experience**

The enhanced system makes demos much more convincing by:
- Using appropriate data sources instead of generic "items"
- Showing relevant column names and data types

## 2025-10-05 20:30 - Workflow Builder: Connection Nodes Finally Working! ‚úÖ

### üîß **Connection Nodes Now Fully Functional**

**Problem:** Connection nodes still weren't clickable
**Root Cause:** Drag handle was covering the nodes (z-index issue)
**Solution:** Repositioned drag handle and increased node z-index

**Final Fix:**
1. ‚úÖ **Drag Handle Repositioned**: Moved from full header to center area only
   - Changed from: `top-0 left-0 right-0 h-16` (covering nodes)
   - Changed to: `top-4 left-12 right-12 h-12` (avoiding nodes)
2. ‚úÖ **Node Z-Index Increased**: From `z-20` to `z-50`
3. ‚úÖ **Explicit Pointer Events**: Added `pointerEvents: "auto"` to all nodes
4. ‚úÖ **Removed Scroll Zoom**: Was annoying during page navigation

**New Drag Behavior:**
- Drag handle is now in the **center of the header**
- Leaves all 4 nodes completely exposed
- Drag area: 48px left/right margins, 12px tall
- Shows tooltip "Drag to move" on hover

### ‚ú® **Scroll Zoom Removed**

**Change:** Removed scroll-to-zoom functionality
**Reason:** User feedback - "annoying when moving around the page"
**Alternative:** Use +/‚àí buttons in header for precise zoom control

**Updated Instructions:**
- Changed from: "Scroll to zoom ‚Ä¢ Shift+drag to pan"
- Changed to: "Use +/‚àí buttons to zoom ‚Ä¢ Shift+drag to pan"
- Step 5 now says: "Use +/‚àí buttons" (not "Scroll or use buttons")

### üéØ **How to Use Connections (Working Now!)**

**To Connect Two Stages:**
1. Add 2+ stages to canvas
2. **Click** the colored dot (node) on Stage 1
3. You'll see a **pulsing blue circle** appear
4. **Click** a colored dot on Stage 2
5. **Animated connection** draws with electrical pulse!

**Connection Nodes Are:**
- **Top**: Center top of card
- **Right**: Center right of card  
- **Bottom**: Center bottom of card
- **Left**: Center left of card

**Visual Feedback:**
- Pulsing circle on source node
- Blue rings on target nodes
- Animated line with flowing pulse
- Directional arrow showing flow

**To Drag Stages:**
- Click and drag the **center area** of the header
- Don't click nodes (they're for connections)
- Don't click buttons/controls
- Grab the title/badge area

### üé® **Z-Index Architecture**

Now properly layered:
```
z-50: Connection nodes (highest - always clickable)
z-30: Header controls (edit/delete buttons)
z-20: Drag handle (middle area only)
z-10: Stage block base
z-0: SVG connections (background)
```

### üêõ **Bug Fixes Summary**

- ‚úÖ **Nodes clickable** - Drag handle no longer covers them
- ‚úÖ **Scroll zoom removed** - No accidental zoom while scrolling page
- ‚úÖ **Z-index fixed** - Nodes always on top
- ‚úÖ **Pointer events** - Explicitly enabled on nodes
- ‚úÖ **Drag area optimized** - Smaller, centered, avoids all nodes

### üìù **Files Modified**

1. `app/workflows-grid-test/page.tsx`
   - Removed `handleWheel()` function
   - Removed `onWheel` event handler
   - Repositioned drag handle (top-4 left-12 right-12 h-12)
   - Updated instructions (removed scroll references)

2. `components/blocks/workflow-v2/StageBlockWizard.tsx`
   - Changed node z-index from `z-20` to `z-50`
   - Added `pointerEvents: "auto"` to all 8 nodes (4 per view)
   - Nodes now guaranteed to be above drag handle

### üé¨ **Test It Now!**

**Quick Test:**
1. Go to Workflow Builder
2. Click "Add Stage" twice
3. Click the **blue dot** at bottom of Stage 1
4. See pulsing circle? ‚úÖ Working!

## 2025-10-05 20:15 - Workflow Builder: Connection Fix + Zoom/Pan System ‚úÖ

### üîß **Critical Connection Bug Fixed**

**Problem:** Connections weren't working - nodes weren't clickable
**Root Cause:** Drag handler on wrapper div was intercepting all clicks
**Solution:** Separated drag and connection interactions

**Fix Details:**
1. ‚úÖ **Separate Drag Handle**: Added invisible 16px drag area at top of each block
2. ‚úÖ **Drag on Header Only**: Only the top portion of each block is draggable
3. ‚úÖ **Nodes Now Clickable**: Connection nodes work perfectly - no interference
4. ‚úÖ **Stop Propagation**: Added `e.stopPropagation()` to drag handler

**How to Use:**
- **To drag a block**: Click and drag the header area (top 16px)
- **To connect blocks**: Click any colored connection node (top/right/bottom/left)
- Connection nodes are always accessible and clickable!

### üîç **Zoom & Pan System**

Built a complete zoom and pan system for unlimited canvas exploration.

**Zoom Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Scroll to Zoom**: Mouse wheel zooms in/out (30% - 200%)
- ‚úÖ **Zoom Buttons**: +/‚àí buttons in header
- ‚úÖ **Zoom Percentage**: Live display shows current zoom level
- ‚úÖ **Reset Button**: One click returns to 100% zoom and centered position
- ‚úÖ **Grid Scales**: Background grid scales with zoom level
- ‚úÖ **Smooth Zoom**: CSS transform for smooth, GPU-accelerated zooming

**Pan Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Shift + Drag**: Hold shift and drag canvas to pan
- ‚úÖ **Middle Mouse**: Use middle mouse button to pan
- ‚úÖ **Pan Indicator**: Cursor changes to "grabbing" while panning
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited Canvas**: Pan in any direction for infinite workspace
- ‚úÖ **Pan + Zoom**: Works perfectly together

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Zoom & Pan State
const [zoom, setZoom] = useState(1)  // 0.3 to 2.0
const [pan, setPan] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 })
const [isPanning, setIsPanning] = useState(false)

// Transform container wraps all content
transform: `translate(${pan.x}px, ${pan.y}px) scale(${zoom})`
```

**Zoom Controls in Header:**
```
[‚àí] [100%] [+] [Reset]
 ‚Üë    ‚Üë     ‚Üë     ‚Üë
 -10% show +10%  back to 100%
```

### üé® **UI Improvements**

1. **Updated Instructions**
   - Changed from 4 to 5 steps
   - Step 3: "Drag Header" (clarifies you drag the top)

- **Center Canvas**: Grid-based visual builder with drag-and-drop
- **Right Inspector**: Selected stage configuration with tabs (Basic, Inputs, Outputs, Team, Timing, Conditions, Notifications)

**5. Stage Templates**
- Pre-configured stage templates for common operations
- Cutting, Sewing, QC Check, Washing, Finishing, Packaging
- Customizable after placement on canvas
- Save custom stages as new templates

**6. Runtime Execution**
- Workflow engine validates prerequisites before stage start
- Tracks stage completions with timestamps and captured data
- Calculates progress percentage
- Enforces sequential order for sequential stages
- Allows parallel execution for async stages
- Evaluates conditions for conditional stages

## 2025-10-06 00:15 - Items Hierarchy System: Level 2 Tab Reorganization

### üìä **Improved Tab Structure for Better UX**
Reorganized content into logical tabs to prevent the line items table from feeling "forgotten" at the bottom.

**New Tab Structure:**

1. **Tab 1: Overview** (Default)
   - Quick stats (6 metric cards)
   - Item details (status, code, workflow, team, location)
   - Variants (editable)
   - Attributes (editable)
   - Team members (CRM interface)
   - Brand access (permissions)
   - Timeline widget

2. **Tab 2: Line Items** 
   - Full line items table with QR codes
   - Real-time stage counters
   - Progress tracking
   - Gets its own dedicated space

3. **Tab 3: Management**
   - Schedule & resource allocation (coming soon)

4. **Tab 4: Messages**
   - Item-specific communications (coming soon)

5. **Tab 5: Files**
   - Attachments & documentation (coming soon)

**Why This Improves UX:**
- ‚úÖ **Overview tab** - All key information organized in one place
- ‚úÖ **Line items get focus** - Dedicated tab prevents feeling "tacked on"
- ‚úÖ **Cleaner navigation** - Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ **Better first impression** - Users land on overview, not data overload
- ‚úÖ **Logical hierarchy** - Overview ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Management/Comms

**Technical Changes:**
- Moved tabs to top of page (before content)
- Wrapped all detail content in "overview" tab conditional
- Line items table in dedicated "items" tab with edge-to-edge display (`-m-6` negative margin)
- Default active tab changed from "items" to "overview"

**Files Updated:**
- `/app/items/[itemCodeId]/page.tsx` - Tab structure reorganization

Created comprehensive data architecture in `/docs/ITEMS_DATA_MODEL.md`:
- **Item Codes**: Represent variants (e.g., "Jacket - M", "Jacket - L") within orders
- **Line Items**: Individual physical units (all generated on order acceptance with unique QR codes)
- **Components**: Sub-parts for complex items with independent workflows
- **Immediate QR Generation**: All line items + components get QR codes when order is accepted (ready for label printing)
- **Variant Handling**: Size/color variations create separate item codes for clean UI display

### üé® **Enhanced Level 1 Items V2 Page** (`/items-v2`)
**Built on new PageTemplate grid system with full malleability**

**New Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Action Icons Row**: Eye (view), Mail (message), Edit, Bell (notifications) for each item code

- `/components/blocks/items/ItemCodesTableV2.tsx` - V2 grid-compatible table with action icons
- `/lib/data/itemCodes.ts` - Mock data for 8 item codes across 5 orders (fashion, defense, accessories)

**Updated Metrics (Real Data):**
- Item Codes: 8 variants (6 active)
- Total Line Items: 1,300 units (713 done)
- In Production: 6 active codes (2 ready)
- Average Progress: 62% completion

**Integration:**
- Registered `items.itemcodes.table` block type in BlockRenderer
- Updated items-v2 page to use MOCK_ITEM_CODES data
- Changed storage keys to avoid conflicts with old data

### üì± **Mobile-First Architecture**
Documented comprehensive **Floor App** requirements in `/docs/ITEMS_HIERARCHY_SYSTEM.md`:
- **Offline-first design**: Factory floor workers scan QR codes on mobile devices
- **Responsive layouts**: Desktop (full malleable grid) vs Mobile (single-column, touch-optimized)
- **QR Code Flow**: Worker scans ‚Üí Instant item info ‚Üí Mark stage complete ‚Üí Sync when online
- **Hardware Support**: Shipping devices to factories for reliable offline operation

### üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**
```
Order (Accepted)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Item Code: "Aurora Jacket - M" (200 units)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Line Item #001 (QR: JKT-AURORA-M-001)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Component #001-A (Denim Panel - has QR)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Component #001-B (Leather Panel - has QR)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Line Item #002...#200
```

**UI Display vs Data Layer:**
- **Data**: 500 line items exist in database (all with QR codes)
- **UI Level 1**: Shows ONE row per item code (clean aggregated view)
- **UI Level 2**: Click ‚Üí See all 200 line items for that code
- **UI Level 3**: Click line item ‚Üí Full details + components

### üìñ **Documentation**
Created two comprehensive planning documents:
1. `/docs/ITEMS_HIERARCHY_SYSTEM.md` (997 lines) - Complete system architecture
2. `/docs/ITEMS_DATA_MODEL.md` (632 lines) - Detailed TypeScript schemas and data relationships

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ‚úÖ Lazy UI loading (show aggregates) but eager data creation (all QR codes upfront)
- ‚úÖ Per-unit QR codes strongly encouraged (usage-based pricing model)
- ‚úÖ Variant separation (size/color = different item codes)
- ‚úÖ Component workflows (independent until assembly stage)
- ‚úÖ Offline sync strategy (queue updates, sync on reconnect)

### üéØ **Next Steps**
- Build Level 2 page: Item View (drill into line items)
- Build Level 3 page: Individual Line Item details (malleable grid)
- Build Level 4 page: Component details
- Integrate Floor App QR scanner

- **Solution**: Collapsible color picker that shows only the active color by default

### üîß **Implementation**

**Collapsed State (Default)**
- Shows active color dot with ring indicator
- Shows chevron button to expand
- Total width: ~2 buttons (very compact!)

**Expanded State**
- Shows all 7 other color options in a row

- ‚úÖ Smooth expand/collapse animation (chevron rotates)
- ‚úÖ Auto-collapse on color selection for clean UX
- ‚úÖ All pointer-events properly set for no interference
- ‚úÖ Responsive and clean design

### üí° **UX Flow**
1. By default: See your current color + expand arrow
2. Click dot or arrow ‚Üí all colors expand
3. Pick new color ‚Üí auto-collapse with new color shown
4. Control panel remains compact at all sizes!

## 2025-10-01 01:15:00 - FINAL FIX: State-Based Control Panels + Selective Pointer Events

### üéØ **The Complete Solution**
- **Problem**: Buttons/icons in control panel still triggered hover on cards below
- **Root Cause**: `pointer-events-auto` on container allowed ALL children to trigger hover
- **Solution**: State-based visibility + selective pointer-events only on clickable elements

### üîß **Two-Part Fix**

**1. State-Based Control Panel Visibility**
- Added `activeControlPanel` state to track which card's panel should show
- `onMouseEnter` on Card sets `activeControlPanel` to that card's ID
- Control panel shows when `activeControlPanel === item.i` (not CSS hover)
- Panel stays visible once triggered until you hover a different card

**2. Selective Pointer Events**
- Control panel container: `pointer-events-none` (ghost mode)
- Each button: `pointer-events-auto` (individually clickable)
- Color dots: `pointer-events-auto` (individually clickable)
- Icons/text: NO pointer-events (transparent)

### ‚ú® **Perfect Behavior Achieved!**
- ‚úÖ Hover over card ‚Üí control panel appears and STAYS visible
- ‚úÖ Hover over button/icon area above card ‚Üí doesn't trigger card below
- ‚úÖ Buttons remain fully clickable (have `pointer-events-auto`)
- ‚úÖ Color picker works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Can grab resize handles anywhere without interference
- ‚úÖ Panel persists while you interact with it (doesn't flicker away)
- ‚úÖ Hover different card ‚Üí new panel appears, old one fades

### üí° **Why This Works**
Combination of JavaScript state management (for persistence) + CSS pointer-events (for selective interaction)

---

## 2025-10-01 01:00:00 - SOLVED: Pointer Events Solution for Control Panels

### üéØ **The Elegant Solution**
- **Problem**: Control panel floating above a card triggered hover on the card below it
- **Root Cause**: The control panel div itself was blocking mouse events and triggering hover states
- **Solution**: `pointer-events-none` on control panel, `pointer-events-auto` on interactive elements

### üîß **Technical Implementation**
```css
/* Control panel container */
pointer-events-none  /* Panel doesn't trigger hover or block mouse events */

/* Interactive elements inside (buttons, color dots) */
pointer-events-auto  /* These ARE clickable */
```

### ‚ú® **Result - Perfect Behavior!**
- ‚úÖ Control panel visible but "transparent" to mouse events
- ‚úÖ Can freely grab resize handles - control panels don't interfere
- ‚úÖ Buttons & color dots inside panel remain fully clickable
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript needed - pure CSS solution
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly in tightly-stacked dashboards
- ‚úÖ All functionality intact: resize, drag, color picker, edit buttons

### üí° **Why This Works**
The control panel is like a ghost - you can see it, its buttons work, but it doesn't block or trigger anything beneath it!

---

## 2025-10-01 00:50:00 - Reverted to Simple Working Version

### üîß **Back to Reliable Functionality**
- **Reverted**: Removed inner hover zone attempts that kept breaking resize handles
- **Current Behavior**: Hover anywhere on card ‚Üí control panel + resize handles appear
- **Why**: Creating selective hover zones broke the CSS `group`/`group-hover` relationship between parent and children
- **Resize Handles**: At `z-40` (highest layer) so they remain clickable even if overlapped by control panels

### ‚ú® **Current State (Functional)**
- ‚úÖ All resize handles work (bottom-right corner, right edge, bottom edge)
- ‚úÖ Control panel appears on hover with color picker
- ‚úÖ All edit functionality restored
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Control panels may appear when trying to grab handles in tightly-stacked layouts
- **Workaround**: Resize handles have high z-index so you can click through overlapping control panels

### üí° **Future Enhancement (If Needed)**
To properly solve the overlap issue would require:
- Custom JavaScript hover detection instead of CSS `group-hover`
- Manual state management for showing/hiding control panels
- More complex event handling logic
- **Decision**: Keep simple CSS solution for now - it works reliably

## 2025-01-02 17:00:00 - CSS Containment Solution - Fixing Floating Content

### Problem Solved
- **Floating Content Issue**: Content inside grid cards was "falling off" and floating in space, breaking visual boundaries
- **Inconsistent Layout**: Different components handled overflow differently, causing unpredictable behavior
- **Boundary Violations**: Text, tables, and other content could escape card boundaries

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing overflow handling** - Content could escape container boundaries
2. **Improper flexbox usage** - Not using `flex-1` and `min-h-0` correctly
3. **Height calculation issues** - Content height not properly constrained
4. **Missing truncation** - Long text could overflow horizontally
5. **Inconsistent container patterns** - Different components handled overflow differently

### Comprehensive Solution Implemented

- **Table Pattern**: Separate fixed header and scrollable body
- **Grid Pattern**: `overflow-hidden` on grid containers and items
- **Text Pattern**: `overflow-auto flex-1` for scrollable text content

#### 3. Key CSS Classes Defined
- `overflow-hidden` - Prevents content from escaping
- `flex-1` - Takes available space
- `min-h-0` - Allows flex items to shrink below content size
- `flex-shrink-0` - Prevents shrinking of fixed elements
- `truncate` - Cuts off long text with ellipsis

#### 4. Implementation Rules Established
1. **Always use `overflow-hidden`** on card containers
2. **Always use `flex-shrink-0`** on fixed-height elements
3. **Always use `flex-1` and `min-h-0`** on flexible content areas
4. **Always use `truncate`** on text that might be long
5. **Always calculate heights correctly** for content areas
6. **Always test at different screen sizes** to ensure containment
7. **Always use `h-8 w-8`** for control panel buttons (32px minimum)
8. **Always use `h-4 w-4`** for icons inside buttons (16px for visibility)
9. **Always use `h-10`** for card headers (40px for adequate space)
10. **Always include descriptive tooltips** on all control buttons
11. **Always provide hover states** with color feedback

## 2024-12-19 16:00 - Implemented Adaptive Layout System for Metric Cards

### Revolutionary Adaptive Layout Approach
Replaced simple responsive scaling with intelligent layout adaptation based on card size:

- **Large Cards (md+)**: Full layout with headers, descriptions, and detailed charts
- **Medium Cards (sm-md)**: Compact layout with mini charts and essential info  
- **Small Cards (<sm)**: Minimal layout showing only value and trend

### MetricChart.tsx Adaptive Layouts
- **Large**: Full header, description, detailed SVG chart with gradients
- **Medium**: Compact header, mini chart with smaller viewBox (100x20)
- **Small**: Just value and trend indicator, no chart

### MetricKPI.tsx Adaptive Layouts
- **Large**: Full layout with trend bar chart
- **Medium**: Compact layout with smaller trend bars
- **Small**: Minimal layout with just value and delta

### MetricItems.tsx Adaptive Layouts
- **Large**: Full card layout with header, icon, description
- **Medium**: Compact layout without description
- **Small**: Minimal layout with value and icon only

### Key Benefits
- **No More Scrollbars**: Content adapts to available space without overflow
- **Always Readable**: Content always visible and readable at any size
- **Intelligent Adaptation**: Layouts change based on available space
- **Maintained Hierarchy**: Visual hierarchy preserved at all sizes
- **Better UX**: Improved experience across all device sizes

### Technical Implementation
- **Conditional Rendering**: Uses `hidden`/`flex` classes to show appropriate layout
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints for layout switching
- **Overflow Prevention**: `overflow-hidden` prevents scrollbars
- **Flexible Content**: Content areas use `flex-1` and `min-h-0` for proper scaling

## 2024-12-19 16:30 - Switched to shadcn Card Components with Container Queries

### Problem Identified
- Custom responsive classes were fighting against shadcn's built-in container query system

@container (max-width: 640px) {
  .card-header { padding: 0.5rem; }
  .card-content { padding: 0.5rem; }
  .card-title { font-size: 0.75rem; }
}

@container (max-width: 480px) {
  .card-header { padding: 0.25rem; }
  .card-content { padding: 0.25rem; }
  .card-title { font-size: 0.625rem; }
}
```

- **Future-Proof**: Container queries are the modern approach to responsive design

## 2024-12-19 17:00 - Fixed Container Query CSS and Improved Metric Card Scaling

### Problem Identified
- Container query CSS was targeting wrong selectors (CSS classes instead of data-slot attributes)
- Metric cards were still showing scrollbars and content overflow
- Default sizes were too large for small containers

### Solution Implemented
- **Fixed Container Query Selectors**: Updated CSS to target `[data-slot="card-header"]` instead of `.card-header`
- **Added !important Declarations**: Ensured container query styles override default shadcn styles
- **Reduced Default Sizes**: Made metric cards start with smaller default sizes
- **Added Overflow Prevention**: Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrollbars

### CSS Fixes
```css
@container (max-width: 640px) {
  [data-slot="card-header"] { padding: 0.5rem !important; }
  [data-slot="card-content"] { padding: 0.5rem !important; }
  [data-slot="card-title"] { font-size: 0.75rem !important; }
}
```

### MetricChart.tsx Improvements
- Reduced default padding and margins
- Smaller default font sizes (`text-xs`, `text-lg`)
- Smaller chart height (`h-6` instead of `h-12`)
- Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrollbars
- Reduced SVG viewBox to `100x20` for better scaling

### MetricKPI.tsx Improvements

## Form Builder & Input Components Implementation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 17:45  
**Status:** Complete

### New Components Added
- **FormBuilder** (`form.builder`): Main form container with slot-based architecture for dynamic form element addition
- **FormInput** (`form.input`): Text input with support for various input types (text, email, password, number, tel, url)
- **FormSelect** (`form.select`): Dropdown select with single/multiple selection and customizable options
- **FormTextarea** (`form.textarea`): Multi-line text input with configurable rows and character limits
- **FormCheckbox** (`form.checkbox`): Checkbox input supporting single checkboxes or multiple checkbox groups
- **FormUpload** (`form.upload`): File upload component with drag-and-drop, file type validation, and size limits
- **FormSection** (`form.section`): Form section dividers for organizing form elements with customizable spacing

### Key Features
1. **Slot-Based Architecture**: FormBuilder uses slot system similar to layout blocks, allowing dynamic addition of form elements
2. **Click-to-Add Functionality**: Users can continuously add form elements at the bottom for fluid form building
3. **Responsive Design**: All form components scale properly within grid containers using CSS containment
4. **Validation Support**: Built-in required field validation and visual indicators
5. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML structure
6. **Drag-and-Drop**: FormUpload includes sophisticated file drag-and-drop with preview and removal
7. **Form State Management**: Centralized form data collection and submission handling

### Technical Implementation
- **Registry Integration**: Full block registry support with proper schemas, mock data, and quick-edit controls
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with Zod schema validation
- **Grid Compatibility**: Seamless integration with both v1 and v2 grid systems
- **Container Queries**: Responsive behavior using CSS containment for optimal scaling
- **Mock Data**: Realistic default values and examples for immediate use in demos

### Use Cases
- **Onboarding Flows**: Multi-step user onboarding with progressive data collection
- **Data Collection**: General purpose forms for gathering user input and feedback
- **Survey/Quiz Building**: Dynamic form creation for assessments and surveys
- **Application Forms**: Job applications, registrations, and other structured data entry

All form components maintain the same design system consistency and functionality as existing blocks, including full quick-edit capabilities and data source integration.

**Note:** While the form components are fully implemented, the FormBuilder's slot-based click-to-add functionality still requires debugging for reliable operation in the v2 grid system.

## Page Creator System Implementation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 18:00  
**Status:** Complete

### New Features Added
- **Page Management Interface** (`/pages`): Central hub for creating, managing, and organizing dashboard pages
- **Dynamic Page Creator** (`/pages/[pageId]`): Creates new blank pages with full v2 grid functionality
- **Page Templates**: Support for both blank pages and predefined templates (like the v2 demo)
- **Navigation Integration**: Added "Pages" section to main sidebar navigation

### Key Features
1. **Create New Pages**: One-click page creation with custom names and descriptions
2. **Blank Page Templates**: New pages start with a welcome block and edit mode enabled
3. **Full Grid Functionality**: Each page includes complete v2 grid system with drag-drop, resize, editing
4. **Page Management**: View, duplicate, delete, and organize pages in a card-based interface
5. **Persistent Storage**: Pages use the same localStorage persistence as the main v2 system
6. **Navigation**: Easy access from sidebar and breadcrumb navigation between pages

### Technical Implementation
- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses Next.js `[pageId]` dynamic routes for flexible page creation
- **Template System**: Configurable page templates with predefined layouts and blank page defaults
- **State Management**: Each page maintains its own grid state with unique storage keys
- **Component Reuse**: Leverages existing v2 grid components (GridSurface, BlockShell, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper grid state typing

### Use Cases
- **Multi-Dashboard Apps**: Create separate dashboards for different teams, projects, or use cases
- **Template Creation**: Build reusable page templates for onboarding or standardization
- **Prototyping**: Quickly create new page layouts for testing and iteration
- **Client Demos**: Generate custom dashboard demos for different client needs

This system provides the foundation for building complex multi-page dashboard applications with the same powerful grid-based component system across all pages.

### Update: Sidebar-Based Navigation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 18:15

**Improved Design**: Moved from directory-based page management to sidebar-integrated navigation:

- **Removed** separate `/pages` directory (bad UX pattern)
- **Added** "New Page" button at top of sidebar with inline input
- **Integrated** dynamic page list directly in sidebar with proper active states
- **Ensured** layout consistency - all new pages use same LayoutScaffold with sidebar
- **Enhanced** page templates with better starter content (welcome note + sample metric/chart)

The sidebar now shows a "Pages" section at the top with the ability to create new pages inline, followed by a list of all created pages. This follows proper navigation UX patterns where the sidebar is the source of truth for page navigation.
