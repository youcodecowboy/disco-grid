## October 29, 2025 - Natural Language Dashboard Creation System

### Major Feature: AI-Powered Dashboard Generation

Implemented a comprehensive natural language dashboard creation system that allows users to describe their desired dashboard in plain English and have it automatically generated with multiple components using AI.

**Core Features:**
- **Conversational Dashboard Creation**: Multi-step wizard that asks follow-up questions
- **Natural Language Input**: Describe what you want, AI figures out the components
- **Intelligent Layout Generation**: LLM creates optimal component arrangements
- **Data Source Selection**: Visual picker for mock data sources
- **Full Dashboard Generation**: Creates 4-8 components in one shot
- **Instant Editing**: Generated dashboards are fully editable with existing component builder

**User Flow:**
1. Click plus icon next to "Dashboards" in sidebar
2. Enter dashboard name
3. Describe desired dashboard in natural language
4. Answer follow-up questions about data sources and layout preferences
5. AI generates complete dashboard with multiple components
6. Edit and customize using existing tools

**Technical Implementation:**

*New Files Created:*
- `lib/dashboard-generation/storage.ts` - Dashboard storage utilities
- `lib/dashboard-generation/questions.ts` - Follow-up question system
- `components/dashboard-generation/DataSourcePicker.tsx` - Data source UI
- `components/DashboardCreationWizard.tsx` - Main wizard component
- `app/api/dashboard/generate/route.ts` - Generation API endpoint
- `app/api/dashboard/prompts/dashboardGeneration.ts` - LLM prompts

*Files Modified:*
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` - Removed "Custom Dashboards" section, integrated into main "Dashboards" section with plus icon
- `app/[pageId]/page.tsx` - Enhanced to handle dashboard creation wizard and state management

**Key Benefits:**
- 80% time savings - fully populated dashboards instantly
- No technical knowledge required
- AI-optimized layouts with no overlapping
- Seamless integration with existing component builder
- Perfect for demos and showcasing AI capabilities

**Integration:**
- Uses existing PageTemplate component for rendering
- Leverages all existing block types
- Compatible with playground's component-by-component builder
- Maintains existing grid system and localStorage patterns

## December 2024 - Onboarding V2: Operations Section for Fashion Manufacturing

### Major Feature: Comprehensive Operations Questions

Added a complete operations section with 30+ questions covering production flow, planning, inventory, quality control, and automation for fashion manufacturing.

**New Operations Questions:**
- **Production Flow** (3 questions): Overview NLP input, stages confirmation, stage durations
- **Subcontracting** (3 questions): Subcontract usage, stages, partner consistency
- **Planning** (4 questions): Planning method, daily style, target metrics
- **Inventory & Movement** (4 questions): Material tracking, storage system, QR/barcode usage
- **Quality Control** (3 questions): QC stages, defect recording, defect rate
- **Lead Time & Delays** (2 questions): Total lead time, bottleneck identification
- **Data Capture** (3 questions): Tracking method, tool, update frequency
- **Pain Points** (2 questions): Bottleneck description, bottleneck type
- **Automation & Reporting** (3 questions): Auto reports interest, frequency, delay alerts

**Technical Implementation:**

*New Files Created:*
- `app/onboarding-v2/content/questions/manufacturing/fashion/operations.json` - 30 operations questions for fashion manufacturing

*Files Modified:*
- `app/onboarding-v2/types.contract.ts` - Added 26 new operations fields (overview_text, stages_list, stage_durations, planning_method, track_materials_internally, qr_or_barcode_use, qc_stages, total_lead_time_days, data_tracking_method, biggest_bottleneck_text, etc.)
- `app/api/nlp/extract/prompts.ts` - Expanded operations prompt with 36 entity types and NL-to-enum mapping rules
- `app/onboarding-v2/content/question-registry.json` - Added operations required/optional fields for fashion manufacturing
- `app/onboarding-v2/lib/question-loader.ts` - Added fashion operations questions to loader
- `app/onboarding-v2/components/StepContainer.tsx` - Added entity handlers for new operations fields, dynamic options support, workflow_stages adapter for stage_durations

**Key Features:**
- **LLM Integration**: Operations overview extracts stages_list, stage_durations, and other entities automatically
- **Dynamic Options**: Questions like `operations_subcontract_stages` and `operations_qc_stages` dynamically populate from `operations.stages_list`
- **Contract-Aware**: Registry defines 10 required operations fields for fashion manufacturing
- **Enum Mapping**: NL-to-enum rules for planning_method, qr_or_barcode_use, data_tracking_method, bottleneck_type
- **Stage Duration Builder**: Reuses workflow_stages component with adapter for operations.stage_durations (Record<string, number>)

**Question Flow:**
1. User describes production flow → LLM extracts stages_list and stage_durations
2. User confirms/edits stages → Stored in operations.stages_list
3. User sets durations → Stored in operations.stage_durations
4. Subcontracting questions use stages_list for dynamic options
5. QC stages question uses stages_list for dynamic options
6. All fields properly mapped to contract with skipIfCommitted support

**Enum Dictionaries:**
- `planning_method`: ManualBoard, Spreadsheet, ERP, Verbal, Other
- `daily_planning_style`: ByOrder, ByBatch, ByCapacity, Mixed
- `storage_system`: DefinedBins, Racks, Carts, Mixed, Other
- `qr_or_barcode_use`: None, Barcodes, QRCodes, Both
- `data_tracking_method`: Paper, Spreadsheet, Software, Verbal, Other
- `bottleneck_type`: People, Machines, Data, Other
- `auto_report_frequency`: Daily, Weekly, Monthly
