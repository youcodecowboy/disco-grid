```css
@container (max-width: 640px) {
  .card-header { padding: 0.5rem; }
  .card-content { padding: 0.5rem; }
  .card-title { font-size: 0.75rem; }
}

@container (max-width: 480px) {
  .card-header { padding: 0.25rem; }
  .card-content { padding: 0.25rem; }
  .card-title { font-size: 0.625rem; }
}
```

### Benefits
- **Proper Scaling**: shadcn's container queries now handle responsive scaling
- **Consistent Design**: All components use the same design system
- **Better Performance**: No more complex conditional rendering
- **Maintainable**: Uses established shadcn patterns
- **Future-Proof**: Container queries are the modern approach to responsive design

## 2024-12-19 17:00 - Fixed Container Query CSS and Improved Metric Card Scaling

### Problem Identified
- Container query CSS was targeting wrong selectors (CSS classes instead of data-slot attributes)
- Metric cards were still showing scrollbars and content overflow
- Default sizes were too large for small containers

### Solution Implemented
- **Fixed Container Query Selectors**: Updated CSS to target `[data-slot="card-header"]` instead of `.card-header`
- **Added !important Declarations**: Ensured container query styles override default shadcn styles
- **Reduced Default Sizes**: Made metric cards start with smaller default sizes
- **Added Overflow Prevention**: Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrollbars

### CSS Fixes
```css
@container (max-width: 640px) {
  [data-slot="card-header"] { padding: 0.5rem !important; }
  [data-slot="card-content"] { padding: 0.5rem !important; }
  [data-slot="card-title"] { font-size: 0.75rem !important; }
}
```

### MetricChart.tsx Improvements
- Reduced default padding and margins
- Smaller default font sizes (`text-xs`, `text-lg`)
- Smaller chart height (`h-6` instead of `h-12`)
- Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrollbars
- Reduced SVG viewBox to `100x20` for better scaling

### MetricKPI.tsx Improvements
- Applied same size reductions as MetricChart
- Smaller trend chart height (`h-4` instead of `h-8`)
- Consistent padding and spacing

### Key Benefits
- **No More Scrollbars**: Content now fits within containers
- **Better Scaling**: Cards scale down properly without overflow
- **Consistent Behavior**: All metric cards now scale uniformly
- **Proper Container Queries**: CSS now correctly targets shadcn components

## 2024-12-19 17:30 - Complete Metric Component Rebuild with Clean Design

### Problem Identified
- Previous approach was fundamentally flawed - trying to fit cards inside cards
- shadcn Card components were adding unnecessary complexity
- Scaling was terrible - small text in huge cards
- Container queries were overcomplicating a simple problem

### Solution: Complete Rebuild
- **Removed shadcn Card Components**: No more nested card structure
- **Window as Card**: The grid window itself is now the card
- **Clean, Simple Layout**: Direct div with proper responsive classes
- **Proper Scaling**: Responsive text sizes that actually work

### New Design Structure
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│    [Large Value]    │  ← Main metric (2xl-5xl responsive)
│   [Trend % + Icon]  │  ← Trend indicator
│                     │
│   [Small Graph]     │  ← Mini chart at bottom
│                     │
│   [Metric Name]     │  ← Title at bottom
└─────────────────────┘
```

### MetricChart.tsx Rebuild
- **Simple div structure**: `bg-white rounded-lg border`
- **Responsive text sizes**: `text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl`
- **Centered layout**: Main value in center, graph and title at bottom
- **Clean spacing**: Proper padding and margins

### MetricKPI.tsx Rebuild
- **Same clean structure**: Consistent with MetricChart
- **Bar chart trend**: Simple bar chart for trend data
- **Responsive scaling**: All elements scale with container

### Key Improvements
- **No nested cards**: Window is the card
- **Proper scaling**: Text sizes scale with container
- **Clean design**: Simple, focused layout
- **Better performance**: No complex CSS or container queries
- **Maintainable**: Simple, straightforward code

### Responsive Behavior
- **Large containers**: Full-size text and charts
- **Medium containers**: Scaled down proportionally
- **Small containers**: Compact but readable
- **No overflow**: Content always fits

## Form Builder & Input Components Implementation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 17:45  
**Status:** Complete

### New Components Added
- **FormBuilder** (`form.builder`): Main form container with slot-based architecture for dynamic form element addition
- **FormInput** (`form.input`): Text input with support for various input types (text, email, password, number, tel, url)
- **FormSelect** (`form.select`): Dropdown select with single/multiple selection and customizable options
- **FormTextarea** (`form.textarea`): Multi-line text input with configurable rows and character limits
- **FormCheckbox** (`form.checkbox`): Checkbox input supporting single checkboxes or multiple checkbox groups
- **FormUpload** (`form.upload`): File upload component with drag-and-drop, file type validation, and size limits
- **FormSection** (`form.section`): Form section dividers for organizing form elements with customizable spacing

### Key Features
1. **Slot-Based Architecture**: FormBuilder uses slot system similar to layout blocks, allowing dynamic addition of form elements
2. **Click-to-Add Functionality**: Users can continuously add form elements at the bottom for fluid form building
3. **Responsive Design**: All form components scale properly within grid containers using CSS containment
4. **Validation Support**: Built-in required field validation and visual indicators
5. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML structure
6. **Drag-and-Drop**: FormUpload includes sophisticated file drag-and-drop with preview and removal
7. **Form State Management**: Centralized form data collection and submission handling

### Technical Implementation
- **Registry Integration**: Full block registry support with proper schemas, mock data, and quick-edit controls
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with Zod schema validation
- **Grid Compatibility**: Seamless integration with both v1 and v2 grid systems
- **Container Queries**: Responsive behavior using CSS containment for optimal scaling
- **Mock Data**: Realistic default values and examples for immediate use in demos

### Use Cases
- **Onboarding Flows**: Multi-step user onboarding with progressive data collection
- **Data Collection**: General purpose forms for gathering user input and feedback
- **Survey/Quiz Building**: Dynamic form creation for assessments and surveys
- **Application Forms**: Job applications, registrations, and other structured data entry

All form components maintain the same design system consistency and functionality as existing blocks, including full quick-edit capabilities and data source integration.

**Note:** While the form components are fully implemented, the FormBuilder's slot-based click-to-add functionality still requires debugging for reliable operation in the v2 grid system.

## Page Creator System Implementation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 18:00  
**Status:** Complete

### New Features Added
- **Page Management Interface** (`/pages`): Central hub for creating, managing, and organizing dashboard pages
- **Dynamic Page Creator** (`/pages/[pageId]`): Creates new blank pages with full v2 grid functionality
- **Page Templates**: Support for both blank pages and predefined templates (like the v2 demo)
- **Navigation Integration**: Added "Pages" section to main sidebar navigation

### Key Features
1. **Create New Pages**: One-click page creation with custom names and descriptions
2. **Blank Page Templates**: New pages start with a welcome block and edit mode enabled
3. **Full Grid Functionality**: Each page includes complete v2 grid system with drag-drop, resize, editing
4. **Page Management**: View, duplicate, delete, and organize pages in a card-based interface
5. **Persistent Storage**: Pages use the same localStorage persistence as the main v2 system
6. **Navigation**: Easy access from sidebar and breadcrumb navigation between pages

### Technical Implementation
- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses Next.js `[pageId]` dynamic routes for flexible page creation
- **Template System**: Configurable page templates with predefined layouts and blank page defaults
- **State Management**: Each page maintains its own grid state with unique storage keys
- **Component Reuse**: Leverages existing v2 grid components (GridSurface, BlockShell, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper grid state typing

### Use Cases
- **Multi-Dashboard Apps**: Create separate dashboards for different teams, projects, or use cases
- **Template Creation**: Build reusable page templates for onboarding or standardization
- **Prototyping**: Quickly create new page layouts for testing and iteration
- **Client Demos**: Generate custom dashboard demos for different client needs

This system provides the foundation for building complex multi-page dashboard applications with the same powerful grid-based component system across all pages.

### Update: Sidebar-Based Navigation
**Date:** January 25, 2025 18:15

**Improved Design**: Moved from directory-based page management to sidebar-integrated navigation:

- **Removed** separate `/pages` directory (bad UX pattern)
- **Added** "New Page" button at top of sidebar with inline input
- **Integrated** dynamic page list directly in sidebar with proper active states
- **Ensured** layout consistency - all new pages use same LayoutScaffold with sidebar
- **Enhanced** page templates with better starter content (welcome note + sample metric/chart)

The sidebar now shows a "Pages" section at the top with the ability to create new pages inline, followed by a list of all created pages. This follows proper navigation UX patterns where the sidebar is the source of truth for page navigation.
