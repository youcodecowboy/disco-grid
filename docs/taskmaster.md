# Taskmaster Suite Blueprint — 05/10/25 07:10

## Mission
- Build a domain-agnostic task nerve center that unites CRM, ERP, operations, and planning teams inside a dedicated `/tasks` home.
- Bind every task to the people, teams, assets, records, and schedules they touch while keeping configuration approachable.
- Make recurring compliance, coordination, and planning tasks effortless through reusable templates, forms, and automation.
- Guarantee traceability so every action is timestamped, attributed, and linked back to items, orders, planner events, and forecasts inside our platform.

## Experience Principles
- **Pared-back power**: quick entry stays default; deeper configuration opens in a slide-out similar to the new order form when advanced options are required.
- **Living master calendar**: the `/tasks` hub revolves around a collaborative calendar where tasks, recurrences, deadlines, and dependencies are visible by person, team, and resource lane.
- **Context sticks with you**: each task carries linked records, forms, files, workflow stages, and conversations so assignees never hunt for information.
- **State clarity from anywhere**: status, blockers, and progress remain legible across list, board, calendar, and kanban views, echoing CRM pipeline affordances.
- **Automation with guardrails**: automated assignments, reminders, and escalations fire predictably and are always exposed in an audit-friendly activity feed.

## Personas & Primary Jobs
- **Team Lead / Coordinator**: schedules recurring responsibilities, balances workload, and unblocks their team.
- **Field or Floor Specialist**: receives daily tasks with embedded forms, captures evidence, and escalates blockers in real time.
- **Project / Account Manager**: orchestrates multi-party deliverables, aligns timelines, and keeps stakeholders informed.
- **Compliance & Quality Owner**: ensures required checklists and attestations happen on schedule and remain auditable.
- **Operations Strategist / Leadership**: monitors throughput, SLA adherence, and cross-team utilization with drill-down analytics.

## Task System Pillars
### Core Entities
- **Task**: atomic unit with title, description, due window, assignees, status, priority, tags, linked records, and completion evidence.
- **Task Template**: reusable blueprint with prefilled fields, checklists, forms, automation rules, and default assignees.
- **Task Series**: recurrence container managing cadence, skip rules, exception handling, and future instance generation.
- **Task Form**: structured data capture bundle (inputs, validations, conditional logic) required before closure when configured.
- **Checklist Item**: ordered subtasks with optional owners, estimated durations, and completion dependencies.
- **Task Artifact**: attachments, notes, photos, and sensor or telemetry readings linked for audit trails.

### Relationships & Attachments
- Tasks link bidirectionally to items, orders, workflows, planner events, locations, assets, and calendar slots within the platform.
- Parent ↔ child tasks support phased work (e.g., discovery → execution → review) with inherited deadlines and handoffs.
- Task bundles group related tasks across teams into milestones for reporting and calendar overlays.
- Cross-linking to `WORKFLOW_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_SYSTEM` rules keeps automation logic discoverable from the task detail view.
- Task creation can originate from planner events, messaging threads, onboarding flows, or workflow triggers to keep work synchronized.

### State Machine & Lifecycle
- Default states: Draft → Scheduled → In Progress → Blocked → Review → Completed → Archived.
- Blockers capture root cause, owner, expected resolution date, and optionally spawn follow-up tasks.
- Tasks cannot move to Completed until mandatory forms, checklists, and time tracking entries are satisfied.
- Late tasks generate escalation signals (in-app, email, SMS) governed by template-level rules and recipient roles.
- Archived tasks retain immutable history for compliance and can be cloned into new series or templates.

## Primary Scenarios
- Auto-generate a task when a planner event (e.g., incoming delivery, customer milestone, facility visit) is scheduled to ensure an owner is ready.
- Cross-team launch checklist tied to a new order or initiative, spanning procurement, implementation, QA, and comms.
- Recurring compliance or maintenance routines with embedded forms and evidence capture.
- Customer follow-up cadence for account teams, linked to CRM opportunities and renewal milestones.
- Strategic planning cadences (quarterly OKRs, forecasting reviews) that roll up into leadership dashboards.

## Calendar & Dashboard Experience
- Master calendar shows tasks, milestones, and recurrences by day, week, month, and timeline views.
- Filtering controls for people, teams, locations, asset classes, templates, and task tags.
- Heatmap overlays reveal workload saturation and flag over-allocated individuals before conflicts escalate.
- Task cards in calendar open a right-side drawer with quick status changes, comment feed, and dependency graph.
- Personal dashboards surface "Today", "This Week", "Escalations", and "Suggested" (AI) with quick actions and recent activity.

## Task Authoring Patterns
- **Quick Create**: inline form with title, assignee, due date, priority, and tag; converts to advanced mode on demand.
- **Guided Form**: full-screen drawer mirroring the new order flow with sections for details, assignments, checklists, forms, automation, and links.
- **Template & Recurrence Studio**: builder that defines cadence, time-of-day rules, blackout windows, exceptions, and default assignees.
- **Planner-to-Task**: one-click conversion or automation that creates tasks from planner events, preserving attendees, time, and notes.
- **Bulk / Programmatic**: CSV import, API endpoints, and rule-based generation from item hierarchies or workflows.
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI hints for due dates, assignees, and related tasks based on historical behavior and current workload.

## Automation & Workflow Wiring
- Task templates trigger platform automations (create follow-up tasks, update statuses, push notifications) when state changes occur.
- Recurring series auto-generate future instances while respecting team calendars, holidays, and resource availability.
- Completion events can update linked records (items, orders, planner events) or notify stakeholders via the messaging bus.
- Condition builder supports if/then logic referencing form values, workflow signals, or planner metadata.
- Future AI models can propose new tasks from planner activity, message threads, sensor anomalies, or historical patterns.

## Canonical Data Model
### Entity Map
| Entity | Purpose | Key fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task | Canonical work unit that carries ownership, timing, and completion evidence | `id`, `title`, `status`, `priority`, `due_window`, `owning_team_id` | Must have either an owning team or at least one owner assignment |

```

### Relationship Rules & Integrity
- Every task must have either `owning_team_id` or at least one `TASK_ASSIGNMENT` with role `owner`; UI prevents publish otherwise.
- A task must keep at least one `TaskContextLink` once it is scheduled; contexts drive breadcrumbing and analytics roll-up.
- `planner_event_id` in `TASK_SCHEDULE_SLOT` is optional; when present, planner edits update the task slot and vice versa through a two-way sync contract.
- `TASK_SERIES` auto-generates child tasks by cloning template payload plus overrides; `sequence` stored in `TaskSeriesRef` inside the task ensures ordering.
- `TASK_DEPENDENCY` enforces graph rules: no circular dependencies, and dependent tasks cannot leave `draft` until predecessors are scheduled.
- Required forms and checklist items must be completed before `status` can change to `completed`; API rejects transitions that violate this rule.
- Blockers pause SLA timers; when an active blocker exists, escalation rules target the blocker owner instead of the task owner.

### Input Contracts & Validation
- Minimum creation payload: `title`, at least one assignment or owning team, at least one context link, optional due window.
- Tasks spawned from planner events inherit `start/end`, `location`, attendees → default assignments; user can detach or override before saving.
- Templates inject default forms, checklist, notifications, and tags; callers can override but cannot delete template-required fields without elevated permission.
- Recurring series define generation horizon and blackout handling; skipped instances are logged in `TASK_ACTIVITY` with reason codes.
- Status transitions follow guard rails: e.g., `draft` → `scheduled` requires due window or schedule, `blocked` requires blocker record, `review` → `completed` requires form sign-off when configured.
- Tag taxonomy lives centrally; free-form tags allowed when user has `manage_tags` permission, otherwise limited to existing tags.

### Derived Data & Analytics Hooks

### Context Fit Check (Step 1 Validation)
- `TaskContextLink` coverage:
  - `order` → `app/orders/new/types.ts#L35` `OrderInfo` supplies `client`, `owner`, and order ID once persisted; tasks store `context_id` matching order UUIDs from orders service.
  - `item` → same file's `ItemProfile` and `ComponentProfile` models expose `id`, `code`, and `orderId`; tasks link to either item instance IDs or component IDs for traceability.
  - `workflow` → workflow assignments surfaced through `ItemProfile.workflow` and `WORKFLOW_LIBRARY`; linking keeps Taskmaster aligned with workflow stages defined in `WORKFLOW_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_SYSTEM`.
  - `team` → `TEAM_DIRECTORY` arrays across planner and order modules provide team identifiers; store canonical `team_id` for load balancing and permissions.
  - `planner_event` → `app/planner/page.tsx` `PlannerEvent` type exposes `id`, `start`, `end`, `location`, `owner`; using `TaskContextLink` plus `TaskScheduleSlot.planner_event_id` ensures bidirectional navigation.
  - `message` & `document` → messages module and attachments share UUID-based identifiers, allowing tasks to anchor discussions or files without schema changes.
  - `custom` → reserved for future modules; metadata bag captures external references when needed.
- `TaskScheduleSlot` sync plan:
  - Planner already normalises `start`/`end` date keys and category lanes; storing those on `TaskScheduleSlot` allows the calendar to overlay planner and task rows with a shared `calendar_id`.
  - When tasks originate from planner events, copy `start`, `end`, `location`, `owner` into the slot; updates from either surface merge guards through the shared `planner_event_id`.
  - Standalone tasks create their own slot record; planner can optionally subscribe to task calendars via `calendar_id`.
- Data gaps / actions:
  - Need persistent IDs for planner events (currently mock strings). Implementation should centralise event storage to keep `planner_event_id` stable.
  - Orders module should expose immutable `order_id` and `item_id` once backend exists; front-end mocks already align on string IDs so adapter logic can be scaffolded now.

- `TASK_ACTIVITY` feeds dashboards for velocity, throughput, and SLA compliance; analytics pipeline aggregates by team, context, and template.
- `TASK_ASSIGNMENT` acknowledgements support individual workload charts and "needs acknowledgement" queues.
- `TASK_SCHEDULE_SLOT` powers availability heatmaps and conflict detection alongside planner load.
- `TASK_CONTEXT_LINK` materializes roll-up views on orders, items, assets, and planner events without denormalizing task bodies.
- Blocker durations, recurrence adherence, and checklist completion rates become first-class metrics to drive AI suggestions.
## Permissions, Notifications & Audit
- Role-based access with overrides per task, template, team, and asset class.
- Sensitive tasks (HR, compliance) can be masked to only reveal metadata to non-privileged viewers.
- Notification matrix supports email, SMS, Slack, and in-app alerts with quiet hours and escalation paths.
- Activity stream records every change, comment, file upload, and automation trigger with user/time context.
- Audit exports bundle form submissions, attachments, and approval signatures for regulatory reviews.

## Analytics & Insights
- Task velocity, completion rates, and SLA adherence segmented by team, template, or linked record.
- Recurrence health dashboards flag skipped, late, or failed tasks and recommend corrective actions.
- Capacity analytics surface workload distribution, allowing planners to reassign before bottlenecks emerge.
- Compliance scorecards show coverage for required tasks (safety checks, renewals, reviews) at a glance.
- Predictive insights leverage historical data to recommend staffing levels, sequencing adjustments, and automation opportunities.

## Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 0 — Foundations (Sprints 1-2)**: baseline task CRUD, assignment, statuses, simple list and board views, foundational data model.
- **Phase 1 — Calendar & Templates (Sprints 3-5)**: master calendar, quick create, template library, recurrence engine, planner-to-task linking.
- **Phase 2 — Forms & Automation (Sprints 6-8)**: task forms, conditional checklists, automation builder, integration with workflow engine, escalation rules.
- **Phase 3 — Deep Platform Integration (Sprints 9-12)**: robust links to items/orders, sensor-triggered tasks, downtime planning, analytics dashboards.
- **Phase 4 — Optimization & AI Assist (Sprints 13-16)**: recommendation engine, predictive scheduling, voice and mobile quick capture, compliance export workflows.

## Open Questions & Next Steps
- How should team-level permissions, tags, and visibility rules inherit across templates, tasks, and planner events?
- Which planner events or message triggers should automatically propose tasks versus require manual confirmation?
- What form builder primitives are required on day one (text, numeric, media, signatures, conditional logic) to support broad use cases?
- Do we need offline-capable task completion for field and floor devices, and what data should sync when connectivity returns?
- What signals and datasets should power the first wave of AI-driven task suggestions and workload balancing?
