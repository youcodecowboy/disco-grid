# Advanced Workflow Tools & Logic System

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Purpose**: Design a powerful, flexible workflow engine with advanced conditional logic, stage types, and automation capabilities

---

## 🎯 Vision Statement

Build a workflow builder that rivals enterprise automation platforms like n8n, Zapier, and Temporal, but tailored specifically for manufacturing and operations management. Users should be able to create sophisticated, conditional workflows that power their entire operating system.

**Core Principle**: The more powerful the workflow builder, the more powerful the entire application.

## 🔍 Research: Best-in-Class Workflow Builders

### n8n - Node-Based Automation
**Key Features:**
- Visual node-based interface
- Conditional routing (IF/Switch nodes)
- Loop nodes for batch processing
- Multiple output paths per node
- Error handling branches
- Webhook triggers
- Timer/Schedule nodes
- Data transformation nodes
- Merge nodes (wait for multiple paths)

**Takeaways:**
- Nodes can have multiple outputs (success, error, different conditions)
- Visual flow makes complex logic easy to understand
- Built-in error handling is critical

---

### Zapier - Multi-Step Zaps
**Key Features:**
- Linear flow with branches
- Filters (continue if X matches Y)
- Delays (wait for specific time)
- Paths (A/B/C routing based on conditions)
- Formatters (data transformation)
- Search actions (find existing records)
- Lookup tables

**Takeaways:**
- Filters are powerful but simple (field comparisons)
- Time-based delays enable workflow pacing
- Data lookup/search is essential

---

### Temporal - Durable Workflows
**Key Features:**
- Activities (atomic work units)
- Signals (external events)
- Queries (workflow state inspection)
- Child workflows
- Compensation logic (rollback)
- Saga patterns
- Long-running workflows

**Takeaways:**
- Need to handle long-running processes (days/weeks)
- External signals trigger workflow progression
- Rollback/compensation for failed stages

---

### Manufacturing-Specific Patterns
**Industry Standards:**
- Quality gates (inspect → pass/fail routing)
- Batch processing (group items)
- Resource allocation (assign to available team/machine)
- Time-based progression (cure for 24 hours)
- Conditional rework loops
- Parallel processing (multiple operations simultaneously)
- Assembly trees (combine multiple items into one)
- Disassembly (one item becomes many)

---

## 🧩 Stage Types & Categories

## 🎛️ Conditional Logic System

### Logic Builder Interface

**Field-Based Conditions:**
```
IF [field] [operator] [value]
THEN [action]
ELSE [fallback action]
```

**Example:**
```
IF item.quantity > 100
THEN route to "Bulk Processing"
ELSE route to "Standard Processing"
```

---

### Available Operators

**Comparison:**
- `equals` (=)
- `not equals` (≠)
- `greater than` (>)
- `less than` (<)
- `greater than or equal` (≥)
- `less than or equal` (≤)
- `contains` (text search)
- `does not contain`
- `is empty`
- `is not empty`

**Logical:**
- `AND` (all conditions must be true)
- `OR` (any condition must be true)
- `NOT` (negate condition)

**Advanced:**
- `in list` (value is in predefined list)
- `matches pattern` (regex)
- `within range` (between X and Y)
- `has changed` (field value changed since last stage)

---

### Condition Types

#### 1. **Field Conditions**
Check item properties:
- `item.status = "approved"`
- `item.quantity > 50`
- `item.priority = "urgent"`
- `item.created_date < 7 days ago`

#### 2. **Time Conditions**
Time-based routing:
- `current_time between 8am and 5pm`
- `day_of_week = Monday`
- `time_in_stage > 2 hours`
- `before deadline`

#### 3. **Team/Resource Conditions**
Availability-based:
- `team.available_capacity > 10`
- `assigned_person.is_available = true`
- `machine.status = "idle"`
- `location.current_load < 80%`

#### 4. **Quality Conditions**
QC-based routing:
- `inspection_result = "pass"`
- `defect_count = 0`
- `measurement_value within tolerance`
- `customer_approval = true`

#### 5. **Quantity Conditions**
Volume-based:
- `batch_size >= 100`
- `items_in_queue > 50`
- `completion_percentage >= 75%`

#### 6. **Custom Data Conditions**
User-defined fields:
- `custom_field_1 contains "urgent"`
- `metadata.special_handling = true`

---

### Multi-Condition Logic

**Complex Conditions:**
```
IF (item.quantity > 100 AND item.priority = "high")
   OR (item.customer_type = "VIP")
THEN route to "Priority Lane"

ELSE IF item.quantity > 50
THEN route to "Standard Lane"

ELSE route to "Small Batch Lane"
```

**Visual Interface:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Condition 1: item.quantity > 100   │ ─┐
│ Condition 2: item.priority = high  │ ─┤ AND
└─────────────────────────────────────┘ ─┘
                ↓ OR
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Condition 3: customer_type = VIP   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                ↓
        Route to Priority Lane
```
