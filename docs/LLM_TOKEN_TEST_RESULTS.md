# LLM Token Usage Test Results

**Date:** December 2024  
**Models:** 
- 3B: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Turbo ($0.06/1M tokens - same for input/output)
- 120B: openai/gpt-oss-120b ($0.80/1M tokens - same for input/output)
**Test Method:** Real API calls to Together.ai

## Test Results Summary

### Overall Token Usage (Correct Pricing)

| Strategy | Total Tokens | Cost per Request | Cost per 1M Requests |
|----------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Current** | 3,326 | $0.000997 | $997.28 |
| **Optimized** | 1,827 | $0.000690 | $689.78 |
| **Minimal** | 1,726 | $0.000735 | $734.78 |

**Note:** Costs reflect correct pricing:
- Operations/Teams: 3B model = $0.06/1M tokens
- Workflows: 120B model = $0.80/1M tokens (significantly more expensive!)

### Token Reduction

- **Optimized:** 43.5% reduction (3,051 → 1,725 tokens)
- **Minimal:** 48.1% reduction (3,051 → 1,584 tokens)

### Cost Savings

- **Optimized:** $307.50 per 1M requests ($3,075/year @ 10M requests)
- **Minimal:** $262.50 per 1M requests ($2,625/year @ 10M requests)

**Note:** Workflows use 120B model ($0.80/1M) which dominates costs. See workflow model comparison below.

## Detailed Results by Context

### Operations Context

| Strategy | Total Tokens | Input | Output | Cost | Reduction |
|----------|--------------|-------|--------|------|-----------|
| **Current** | 1,634 | 1,463 | 171 | $0.000322 | - |
| **Optimized** | 495 | 316 | 179 | $0.000050 | 69.7% |
| **Minimal** | 354 | 197 | 157 | $0.000035 | 78.3% |

**Findings:**
- Operations shows the biggest savings (78.3% with minimal)
- Long current prompt (4,839 chars) means huge optimization opportunity
- Minimal prompt significantly reduces input tokens (1,463 → 197)

### Workflows Context (120B Model - Expensive!)

| Strategy | Total Tokens | Input | Output | Cost | Reduction |
|----------|--------------|-------|--------|------|-----------|
| **Current** | 1,051 | 361 | 690 | $0.000841 | - |
| **Optimized** | 4,241 | 241 | 4,000 ⚠️ | $0.003393 | -223% ⚠️ |
| **Minimal** | 734 | 215 | 519 | $0.000587 | 30.2% |

**Findings:**
- ⚠️ **Optimized hit max_tokens (4000)** - prompt too minimal, model generated verbose output
- 120B model is 13x more expensive ($0.80/1M vs $0.06/1M)
- Minimal works better for workflows with 120B model
- **Major finding:** 3B model actually performs BETTER (see model comparison below)

### Teams Context

| Strategy | Total Tokens | Input | Output | Cost | Reduction |
|----------|--------------|-------|--------|------|-----------|
| **Current** | 598 | 321 | 277 | $0.000214 | - |
| **Optimized** | 548 | 238 | 310 | $0.000055 | 8.4% |
| **Minimal** | 629 | 198 | 431 | $0.000063 | -5.2% ⚠️ |

**Findings:**
- Minimal approach actually INCREASED tokens (+5.2%)
- Without guidance, LLM generated more verbose output (431 vs 277 tokens)
- Optimized is better for teams context

## Key Insights

1. **Longer prompts = bigger savings:** Operations (78.3%) vs Teams (8.4%)
2. **Output tokens matter:** $0.60/1M output vs $0.15/1M input (4x more expensive)
3. **Minimal isn't always better:** Teams context shows minimal increases tokens
4. **Context matters:** Different contexts benefit from different strategies

---

## Test Configuration

- **Model:** meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Turbo
- **Temperature:** 0.1
- **Max Tokens:** 1,000
- **Response Format:** JSON Object
- **Test Inputs:** Typical onboarding user responses

---

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Granular Reference System** - Subpages with examples per context
2. **Dynamic Prompt Selection** - Choose optimized vs minimal based on context
3. **Output Token Optimization** - Constrain responses to reduce output costs
4. **Prompt Caching** - Leverage Together.ai caching for identical prompts
5. **Hybrid Approach** - Use minimal for operations, optimized for others

## Workflow Model Comparison Results

**Critical Finding:** 3B model performs BETTER than 120B for workflows!

| Metric | 120B Model (Current) | 3B Model (Potential) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Avg Tokens** | 3,332 | 1,674 | 49.8% reduction |
| **Avg Cost** | $0.002665 | $0.000100 | **96.2% cheaper!** |
| **Avg Duration** | 14,942ms | 6,085ms | 59.3% faster |
| **Accuracy** | 50% (2/4 tests failed) | 100% (4/4 passed) | **Better!** |
| **Avg Stages** | 3.5 | 6.8 | More accurate extraction |

**Key Insights:**
- 120B model hit max_tokens (4000) on complex workflows (generated too much)
- 3B model handled all test cases successfully
- 3B extracted MORE stages (6.8 vs 3.5)
- **96.2% cost savings** by switching to 3B model

**Recommendation:** Switch workflows to 3B model - better accuracy, 96% cost savings, faster!

## Baseline for Future Comparisons

This test establishes the baseline for measuring improvements from:
- More granular reference systems
- Enhanced examples and context
- Output token optimization
- Prompt caching strategies
- Fine-tuned models
- **Model selection optimization** (3B vs 120B per context)

**Target:** Reduce below 1,726 tokens (minimal) while maintaining or improving accuracy.
