# Workflow V2 Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### What We Built

#### 1. **WorkflowStageBlock Component** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `components/blocks/workflow-v2/WorkflowStageBlock.tsx`

A beautiful, feature-rich stage block component that serves as the visual representation of each workflow stage.

**Features:**
- **Color-coded by stage type:**
  - üîµ Process (blue) - Standard work steps
  - üü† Decision (orange) - QC gates or approvals
  - üü£ Input (purple) - Data collection points
  - üü¢ Output (green) - Completion checkpoints
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Wait (gray) - Time delays
  - ‚ö° Automation (pink) - Automated actions

- **Execution type badges:**
  - ‚Üí Sequential: Must happen in order
  - ‚áÑ Async: Can happen in any order
  - ‚áâ Parallel: Multiple simultaneous execution

- **Input/Output indicators:**
  - Visual badges showing all inputs required to start stage
  - Visual badges showing all outputs required to complete stage
  - Required field indicators (red asterisk)
  - Icons for different input types (QR scan, photo, form, etc.)

- **Stage metadata display:**
  - Estimated duration
  - Assigned team/role
  - Location
  - Status (draft/published/archived)
  - Active/completed state

- **Connection anchors:**
  - 4 connection points (top, right, bottom, left)
  - Visible as colored dots on card edges
  - Will be used for drawing connection arrows

- **Interactive features:**
  - Click to select
  - Visual selection state (thick border + ring)
  - Hover effects
  - Expandable details

#### 2. **Workflow Builder Page** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `app/workflows-v2/page.tsx`

A fully functional workflow builder page using our standardized grid system.

**Features:**
- **Three-section layout:**
  - Header with action buttons (Add Stage, Save, Test Run, Edit/Preview)
  - Workflow info card showing name, description, stage count, duration
  - Legend showing stage types and execution patterns
  - Grid canvas with drag-and-drop stage blocks
  - Instructions panel with quick tips

- **Grid integration:**
  - Uses `LayoutScaffold` for consistent page layout
  - Uses `GridSurface` for the canvas with grid background
  - Uses `BlockShell` to wrap stage blocks
  - Uses `useGrid` hook for state management
  - Drag-and-drop repositioning in edit mode
  - Collision detection and auto-resolution
  - LocalStorage persistence

- **Sample workflow:**
  - Pre-loaded with 8-stage denim manufacturing workflow
  - Shows real examples of sequential, async, and parallel stages
  - Demonstrates inputs, outputs, team assignments, timing

- **Mode switching:**
  - Edit mode: Grid background, drag-and-drop enabled
  - Preview mode: Clean view, no grid background

#### 3. **Navigation Integration** ‚úÖ
**Location:** `components/Sidebar.tsx`

Added "Workflows V2" to the Core section of the sidebar navigation.

**Updates:**
- New menu item with Workflow icon
- Active state highlighting
- Added to reserved routes list

## Current Capabilities

### What Works Now ‚úÖ
1. **Beautiful visual stage cards** with all metadata
2. **Grid-based canvas** with drag-and-drop repositioning
3. **Stage selection** (click to select, shows border)
4. **Edit/Preview modes** toggle
5. **Collision detection** and auto-resolution
6. **LocalStorage persistence** of layout
7. **Connection anchors** visible on cards
8. **Responsive layout** that adapts to viewport
9. **Stage type differentiation** through colors

### What's Visual-Only (Not Functional Yet)
1. **Add Stage button** - UI only, doesn't create new stages yet
2. **Save Workflow button** - UI only, doesn't persist to backend yet
3. **Test Run button** - UI only, doesn't execute workflow yet
4. **Connection arrows** - Anchors visible but no drawing yet
5. **Inspector panel** - No side panel for stage configuration yet
6. **Stage library** - No left sidebar with templates yet

### State Management
- **Grid State:** Managed by `useGrid` hook
  - `layout`: Array of grid positions for each stage
  - `blocks`: Object mapping stage IDs to block configs
  - `mode`: "edit" | "save"
- **Selection State:** Managed locally
  - `selectedStageId`: Currently selected stage
- **Drag State:** Managed by `useGrid`
  - `draggedBlock`: ID of block being dragged
  - `dragPreview`: Preview position during drag

### Data Model
Each stage block stores:
- **Identity:** id, name, description
- **Type:** process, decision, input, output, wait, automation
- **Execution:** sequential, async, parallel
- **Position:** sequencePosition (for sequential stages)
- **I/O:** inputs[], outputs[]
- **Assignment:** assignedTeam, assignedRole, location
- **Timing:** estimatedDuration
- **Status:** draft, published, archived

### Grid System Integration
- Uses **grid-v2** standardized system
- **12-column grid** with 40px row height
- **8px gutters** between blocks
- **Collision detection** prevents overlaps
- **Auto-fit** adjusts height to content
- **Drag-and-drop** in edit mode
- **Resize handles** for width/height adjustment

### What Users Can Do Now
1. ‚úÖ See a complete visual workflow with 8 stages
2. ‚úÖ Drag stages around to rearrange the workflow
3. ‚úÖ Select stages to see them highlighted
4. ‚úÖ Switch between edit and preview modes
5. ‚úÖ See all stage metadata (inputs, outputs, team, timing)
6. ‚úÖ Understand stage types through color coding
7. ‚úÖ Identify execution patterns (sequential, async, parallel)

### What's Next
The foundation is solid! The next critical pieces are:
1. **Connection drawing** - Make those anchors functional
2. **Inspector panel** - Configure stages in detail
