# Onboarding V2: Progress Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED** - Major Achievements

### 1. **UI/UX Professional Design** ✨
**Status:** Fully implemented and balanced

**What Changed:**
- ✅ **Standard Header** - 32px logo (h-8), 56px height (h-14), matches app design perfectly
- ✅ **Section Navigation Tabs** - All 9 sections with completion tracking, green checkmarks, clickable
- ✅ **Two-Column Layout** - 4/8 grid split, instructions on left, inputs on right
- ✅ **Balanced Sizing** - Not too big, not too small, everything readable and professional
- ✅ **Enhanced Footer** - Progress bar (h-1), step counter (text-sm), proper button sizing

### 2. **Functional Inputs** 🎯
**Status:** All core input types are now fully functional

**Implemented:**
- ✅ **Text Input** - py-3 text-base, saves to contract, shows current value
- ✅ **Yes/No Buttons** - px-8 py-5, visual selection state, checkmark on selected
- ✅ **Multiple Choice** - px-5 py-4, radio circle selection (w-5 h-5), persists selection
- ✅ **File Upload** - Base64 encoding, preview uploaded image (h-20), click to change
- ✅ **NLP Textarea** - min-h-[120px], character counter, shows "Detected" chips after 50 chars
- ✅ **Auto-save** - 10-second interval, visual indicator in header, localStorage persistence

### 3. **Section Completion Tracking** ✅
**Status:** Fully implemented

**Features:**
- ✅ **Completion Detection** - `getSectionCompletion()` checks all required questions
- ✅ **Visual Indicators** - Green background + ✓ on completed sections
- ✅ **Section Navigation** - Click tabs to jump to first question in that section
- ✅ **Progressive Access** - Sections unlock as you complete them
- ✅ **Smart Tracking** - Checks for non-empty, non-null, non-empty-array values

**How It Works:**
```typescript
// Each input uses question.mapsTo to update the correct contract field
const handleUpdate = (value) => {
  // Updates contract.company.name or contract.operations.model, etc.
  updateContract({ [path]: value });
};
```

### 3. **Visual Feedback & States** 🎨

- ✅ Selected states with checkmarks (yes/no) or filled circles (multiple choice)
- ✅ Upload preview shows image inline
- ✅ Character counters show current/max length
- ✅ Disabled states properly styled
- ✅ Smooth transitions on all interactions

### 4. **Data Persistence** 💾
**Status:** Fully implemented

- ✅ Auto-saves to localStorage every 10 seconds
- ✅ "Saved X minutes ago" indicator in header
- ✅ Resume flow on page reload
- ✅ User-scoped storage keys (ready for multi-user)
- ✅ Idempotency keys for safe regeneration

## 🔨 **IN PROGRESS** - Next Priorities

### 1. Lego-Style Attribute Builder (High Priority)
**What:** Additive UI for custom attributes in Items section
**Why:** Core to the onboarding experience, showcases the "Lego UI" pattern
**Status:** Not started
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Design:**
- Start with 3 default attributes (Name, Code, Quantity)
- "+ Add Attribute" button
- Each attribute: Name input, Type dropdown, Required toggle, Remove button
- Drag handles for reordering
- Live preview showing how attributes will appear

### 2. Workflow Stages Builder (High Priority)
**What:** Visual builder for workflow stages with drag-to-reorder
**Why:** Essential for Operations configuration
**Status:** Not started
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

**Design:**
- List of stage cards
- Add/remove buttons
- Drag to reorder (using framer-motion or dnd-kit)
- Each stage: Name, Duration, Owner, QA checkbox
- Expandable details

### 3. Site Map Integration (High Priority)
**What:** Import existing `/app/map/components/SiteMapView.tsx` into Sites section
**Why:** Reuse existing, tested component for floor plan building
**Status:** Not started
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour (just integration)

**Action:**
```tsx
import { SiteMapView } from '@/app/map/components/SiteMapView';

// In Sites question type:
case 'site_map_builder':
  return <SiteMapView onSave={(data) => handleUpdate(data)} />;
```

### 4. Section Completion Tracking (Medium Priority)
**What:** Track which sections are complete, show green checkmarks
**Why:** Allows jumping back to edit, shows progress
**Status:** Not started
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

**Logic:**
```typescript
// In store:
getSectionCompletion(sectionId) {
  const sectionQuestions = questions.filter(q => q.section === sectionId && q.required);
  const answeredQuestions = sectionQuestions.filter(q => {
    const value = get(contract, q.mapsTo);
    return value !== undefined && value !== null && value !== '';
  });
  return answeredQuestions.length === sectionQuestions.length;
}
```

### 5. NLP Extraction (Medium Priority)
**What:** Wire NLP input to `/lib/nlp.intents.ts` matcher
**Why:** Showcase natural language processing capability
**Status:** Not started
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

**Implementation:**
- Debounce textarea input (500ms)
- Call `matchIntent(input)` from nlp.intents.ts
- Show extracted entities as chips below textarea
- Allow editing/confirming entities
- Populate contract with extracted data

## 💡 **TECHNICAL NOTES**

### Data Flow
```
User Input → handleUpdate(value) → updateContract({...}) → 
→ Zustand Store → Auto-save (10s) → localStorage → 
→ Resume on reload
```

### Contract Structure
All data maps to `GenerationContractV1`:
- `company.name` - Company name
- `company.logoUrl` - Base64 logo image
- `operations.model` - MTO/MTS/hybrid
- `items.attributes` - Array of custom attributes
- `workflows.stages` - Array of workflow stages
- etc.

### Question Structure
Each question in `questions.en.json` has:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `type` - Input type (text_input, yes_no, multiple_choice, etc.)
- `mapsTo` - Dot path into contract (e.g., "company.name")
- `prompt` - Main question text
- `helper` - Helper text
- `options` - For multiple choice
- `required` - Boolean flag

### Adding New Question Types
1. Add type to `QuestionType` union in `/types.ts`
2. Add case to `QuestionRenderer` switch in `StepContainer.tsx`
3. Implement input component with `handleUpdate(value)` on change
4. Use `currentValue` to show selected state
5. Add question to `questions.en.json` with correct `mapsTo` path

## 🎨 **DESIGN DECISIONS**

### Why No Floating Cards?
Floating cards felt disconnected from the page. The new design integrates questions directly into the page layout, making them feel purposeful and permanent.

### Why Large Fonts?
Onboarding is a focused activity. Large fonts (text-4xl headlines, text-xl inputs) make questions prominent and reduce cognitive load.

### Why Section Navigation?
Users need to see the scope of the onboarding ("9 sections") and be able to jump back to completed sections to edit. The horizontal bar provides this context.

### Why Yes/No with Emojis?
Makes binary choices feel friendly and approachable. The checkmark on selected reinforces the choice visually.

### Why Multiple Choice with Radio Circles?
Standard UI pattern that users understand instantly. The filled circle on selection provides clear visual feedback.

### Why Character Counters?
Guides users on how much detail to provide, especially for NLP inputs where we recommend 50-300 characters.
