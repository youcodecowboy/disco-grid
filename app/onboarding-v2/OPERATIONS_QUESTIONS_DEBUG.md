# Operations Questions Debug Guide

## Current Status

The fashion operations questions file (`app/onboarding-v2/content/questions/manufacturing/fashion/operations.json`) contains **30 questions** matching your MD specification.

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Browser Console** - Look for these logs:
   ```
   [Question Loader] ‚úÖ Loaded X questions from registry for manufacturing.fashion
   [Question Loader] Operations questions: 30
   [Question Loader] üîç Operations questions from manufacturing/fashion/operations: 30
   [Question Loader] ALL operations IDs: [...]
   ```

2. **Check Question Filtering** - Look for:
   ```
   [Onboarding] üìä Question Summary:
     Operations loaded: 30, Operations visible: X
   ```
   If `visible` < `loaded`, questions are being filtered out.

3. **Check Filter Reasons** - Look for:
   ```
   [Question Engine] ‚ùå Skipping operations question "X": industry mismatch
   [Question Engine] ‚ùå Skipping operations question "X": dependencies not met
   [Question Engine] ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping operations question "X": already answered
   ```

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Operations fields already committed
**Symptom**: Operations questions have `skipIfCommitted: true` and are skipped
**Fix**: Check if operations fields are being set during company section

### Issue 2: Old questions from legacy files
**Symptom**: Seeing `operations_model_nlp`, `operations_shifts`, `operations_seasonality`
**Fix**: Already fixed - these now have `subIndustries: ["general"]` so they won't show for fashion

### Issue 3: Questions appearing in wrong order
**Symptom**: Operations questions mixed with company questions
**Fix**: Check question order in registry loadOrder

2. Check console logs - they will tell you exactly what's happening
3. Share the console output so we can identify the exact issue
