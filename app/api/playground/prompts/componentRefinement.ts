   - Category: "just products", "exclude returns", "only active"

2. VISUALIZATION CHANGE
   - Type: "change to bar chart", "make it a donut", "show as table"
   - Size: "make it bigger", "compact view", "full width"

3. CONFIGURATION ADJUSTMENT
   - Sorting: "sort by revenue", "alphabetical", "newest first", "descending"
   - Grouping: "group by month", "break down by category", "daily instead"
   - Aggregation: "show average instead", "total per day", "count instead of sum"
   - Limit: "show more", "top 3", "increase to 20", "reduce items"

4. TITLE UPDATE
   - "rename to X", "better title", "more descriptive"

  "newComponentType": null,
  "configChanges": {
    "filterCriteria": { "status": "completed" }
  },
  "newTitle": "Completed Orders",
  "reasoning": "Added status filter to show only completed orders",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

Example 6: Show More
Current: { type: "v3.chart.bar", title: "Top 5 Products", config: { limit: 5 } }
Request: "show more"
Response:
{
  "modificationType": "configAdjust",
  "newComponentType": null,
  "configChanges": {
    "limit": 10
  },
  "newTitle": "Top 10 Products",
  "reasoning": "Increased limit from 5 to 10 to show more items",
  "confidence": 0.9
}

Example 7: Time Expansion with Data Points
Current: { type: "v3.chart.donut", title: "Revenue Sources", config: {} }
Request: "first 3 months"
Response:
{
  "modificationType": "configAdjust",
  "newComponentType": null,
  "configChanges": {
    "limit": 3,
    "timeFilter": "3months"
  },
  "newTitle": "Revenue Sources (First 3 Months)",
  "reasoning": "Limited data to first 3 months by setting limit to 3 data points",
  "confidence": 0.95

Example 8: Time Expansion Range
Current: { type: "v3.chart.area", title: "Sales (Last Month)", config: { timeFilter: "month" } }
Request: "show whole year"
Response:
{
  "modificationType": "configAdjust",
  "newComponentType": null,
  "configChanges": {
    "limit": 12,
    "timeFilter": "year"
  },
  "newTitle": "Sales (Full Year)",
  "reasoning": "Extended time range to full year (12 months)",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

SMART INFERENCE:
- "show more" → double the limit (5→10, 10→20)
- "simplify" → reduce limit or change to simpler viz
- "make bigger" → increase component size (handled by system)
- "better" → suggest specific improvements based on context
- "last X months/days" → set limit to X data points
- "first X months/days" → set limit to X data points
- "whole year" → set limit to 12 (months)
- "top X" → set limit to X

IMPORTANT:
- Only include fields in configChanges that actually change
- Set newComponentType to null if type doesn't change
- Set newTitle to null if title doesn't change
- Be confident about clear requests, lower confidence for ambiguous ones
- If confidence < 0.6, explain why in reasoning

Always preserve the user's intent while improving clarity.`;
