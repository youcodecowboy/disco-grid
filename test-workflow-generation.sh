DESCRIPTION="We run a denim manufacturing factory. Our process starts with fabric inspection where we check quality. Then we do cutting where fabric is cut into panels. After cutting, the fabric needs to rest for 2 hours before sewing. Next is sewing where pieces are assembled. Then washing for denim items only. After washing, we do finishing with buttons and patches. Then QA inspection where a manager must approve. Finally packaging where items are counted and labeled. The cutting team handles cutting, sewing team does sewing, and QA team does inspection."
